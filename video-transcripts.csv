like I could autograph your menus after dinner but I better not see those on eBay no no no we're just excited to meet the man who landed This brilliant woman here oh that wasn't hard she threw herself at me now getting the universe to show me its naughty bits that that took some doing Sheldon's a physicist oh oh that's nice Amy I recently read your paper on lesions and the olfactory receptors in the brain it was inspired oh well I guess it didn't stink if it did that route wouldn't have known it I'm sorry I'm sure you don't want to sit here and listen to a bunch of work talk oh no I love it no but let's talk about work Amy's work my work yeah why don't we start with my work actually I do have a question for Dr Cooper when Amy first told you about her approach to synaptic tracing did you think it was going to revolutionize the field really that's your question what are you Entertainment Tonight you know what I'm going to give you a better question here um Dr Cooper I heard you were working on a top secret project for the US military why don't you tell us about that see that's a great question okay what was that like I can't tell you that is top secret hi you wanted to see me yes I wanted to talk to you about the email you sent me last night I sent you an email you bet you did hello Shalom and Aloha from the grave of Richard Fineman oh it's coming back to me please accept the following retraction I know I said physics is dead but it is the opposite of dead if anything it is Undead like a zombie speaking of which if Richard Fineman came back as a zombie I would totally let him bite any chance that's the end I got bit by a squirrel once I had to get rabies shots I cried so much my mother said don't be a baby in conclusion physics is great squirrels suck and someday I'm going to put my mom in in a cheap nursing home Yours Truly XOXO Dr Leonard hoffstead I I can explain PS can you come pick us up the Uber driver won't open the door because Sheldon is covered in blue

hear we don't need GPS let's just see where the road takes us I see why you turned it off that guy sounds like an idiot honey that's you don't be silly my voice is deep and sonorous like a Caucasian James Earl Jones Luke I am your father see it is you I recorded you in your sleep oh look a hitchhiker I bet he has some interesting stories that's me it's you so you spied on me in my sleep Sheldon I'm sorry you've been doing this every night I couldn't help but wonder if it meant something well it doesn't are you sure I mean the prefrontal cortex regulates impulse control so it's plausible that when we're asleep aspects of our personality that we repress might come out don't try to put science lipstick on your new age Pig and for the record you make noises when you sleep and I've never accused you of repressing your inner chainsaw if you want me to object at your wedding just give me one of these just wish I could make Howard feel as angry as I'm feeling well maybe you could do something he likes and make him jealous like what what you ever read Tom Sawyer no chores he likes chores oo what kind of chores well you could change the batteries and the smoke detectors that would drive him crazy great oh he'll be so mad smoke will be coming out of his ears yeah then the smoke detectors will detect it wa hold on why' you ask me about Tom Sawyer I'm just interested in you what you are sweeter than your applesauce okay I put new batteries in the smoke detectors did you do the laundry I sure did oh he's going to be steamed just like his dress shirts at least he could still clean the oven so that's something no that's what he thinks where's your steel wool right here we may quite the team okay you ready yeah almost I'm working on my facial expressions see uh I've got interested I've got very interested and enraged why would you be enraged better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it okay and rolling hello I am the thetical physicist Dr Sheldon Cooper auditioning for the role of Professor Proton now Excuse me while I get into character hello I'm Professor Proton and today boys and girls we're going to have fun with science did you know you could calculate the mass of an electron using household items it's true all you'll need is a pencil some paper dry ice rubbing alcohol and a spool of 50 Micron thick Cobalt 60 wire and remember don't put it in your mouth or instead of becoming a scientist you'll become wildly radioactive hang on I have a question do you have any experiments that aren't life-threatening come on that was a perfect take and you ruined it oh look hey I did need enraged oh boy what the cast the new Professor Proton is it Sheldon not exactly we turn it's will eat I don't get how you can enjoy Cricket it makes no sense did you just come here to complain yeah that's a sport of my people oh that's rabi Chandra and Ashwin he's amazing he makes hardik panda look like baneswar Kumar whoa whoa whoa whoa save some syllables for the rest of us hey I think that's Bernadette's friend over there oh yeah hey Richie I I hope this isn't awkward the last time we met I kind of embarrassed myself let's see if he can go two for two hey guys he are you here by yourself yeah I couldn't convince anyone to come watch cricket with me tell me about it I had to drag this guy you're more than welcome to join us if you'd like thanks what' she say a that clears that up she's telling the bowler to bowl a yker it's the most brutal ball in cricket I was at the match when sh bow back to back ykers well I was there too what a coincidence well there were 120,000 people at that match so yeah India right everywhere you go there's like 120,000 people so what do you think of our chances at the World Cup uh World Cup you know it'll all depend if CO's batting in form I know it doesn't even matter how many all rounders you have isn't that the truth you know I was the best leg spinner in my high school yeah like I bow the meanest googly speaking of googies I'm going to go before Sheldon gets here last time we did that he didn't talk to us for a month so do it hold on where is he according to his text he was on the second floor then he stopped to tie his shoe all tied and hello hi sorry we're late Amy took forever tying my shoe all right who's excited to see a documentary oh I know this one nobody ever hey this one's going to be great this is about the Rivalry between a cool Renegade scientist Nicola Tesla and his arch nemesis Thomas Edison it's the greatest scientific Feud of all time I mean you can forget about Liz and Newton done so Tesla is the one that invented the electric car no Benny no the car is just named after him okay you don't have to be so smug about it you know you went to see the movie it because you thought it was about scary it guys Tesla was a genius who invented our electrical grid Edison just wanted to get rich and famous didn't he invent the light bulb that's what he wants you to think but without the foundational work of ebenzer kennersley Warren De and James Bowman Lindsay you wouldn't know Edison any more than you know Ebenezer kennersley Warren De Lao or James Bowman Lindsay isn't he sexy All Fired Up it really gets my current alternating if you know what I mean Addison was kind of a publicity hog and a bully yeah he electrocuted an elephant named Topsy just to make himself famous if I had an elephant named Topsy he would want for nothing also he'd be named jumbo and worse than that Edison filmed the first onc screen kiss so he's basically a pornographer although every time I put that in Wikipedia someone takes it out is your current still alternating we're lucky there aren't any elephants in here want to grab some lunch you know what I don't think so let me guess you're not eating because the Mean Girls circled your chubby bits and marker no that that right there that's the reason you're always making fun of me well those are just jokes it's my way of saying that we're friends and it wouldn't hurt you to drop a few see no wonder I don't have any confidence come on you can't blame that on me why not 15 years of constant ridicule I I think our relationship has become toxic what are you saying I think you and I need to spend some time with away from each other look I I can see you're upset but I'm going to need some ground rules while we're apart can I see other needy Indian men get out on today's episode we're going to start with some viewer emails oh take off your glasses so people can't see your password in the reflection oh sure okay

can we do one more now I think these guys need to get some food by pushing a lever at the end of an obstacle course that we design no by opening the door to a hanger and letting the airplane fly in although Sheldon maybe it could be an experiment are you suggesting we color code their food so we can examine their diapers later sure these diapers are going to be full of data never thought I would see Sheldon enjoying himself around baby so much yeah how about that so he just happened to stumble upon a book about experimenting with them the same day we were hanging out with Howard's kids yep don't overthink it oh my God at Sleepaway Camp my cabin was called control group and the absence of side effects means that inflamex can be taken in conjunction with other medications It's a Brand New Day such a good tagline I forgot who came up with that you did that's right I did okay I know it's late I'm working you guys really hard heart so I have a little treat for you we get to go home no you

tell hie that story the other night and I thought it was so sweet that steart and I turned it into a book The frightened little astronaut that looks just like you look how tiny and scared you look and the best part is steuart showed it to a publisher friend of his and they're interested in it that is so cool absolutely not why because I don't want the whole world to know I was the frightened little astronaut maybe you should have called it the little astronaut [Music] once upon a time there was a little astronaut who was sitting in a rocket waiting to go to space and while all the other astronauts laughed and joked he stayed quiet because he had a secret he was scared he had another secret too he was only pretending to be scared to trick the alien [Applause] king Howie fine there was no alien there was a bossy wife though we'll get to her later hey good news they're inviting several Noel laurates to our reception how great like who uh makota Kobayashi what I may have been less than kind to him about this Nobel Prize win why I was jealous angry and new to Twitter it was a dangerous combination okay okay so scratch Kobayashi uh George smoot's on here we have a history Soul pearlmutter oh what about Kip Thorn yeah we now that was a misunderstanding I didn't know he was right behind me so you've alienated everyone we need to help us well Amy if I'd known that someday we need them I would never have insulted them well well that doesn't make it better oh well that's also not true it's for the Nobel laurates we need them on our side but unfortunately Sheldon no unfortunately Sheldon that's all you got to say well so you need these people's support and you're sending them baked goods yeah they're pretty smart don't you think they're going to realize it's just a bribe no You' think but sometimes brilliant people can be painfully oblivious to social cues thank you for pointing that out Sheldon [Music] anytime Sheldon Cooper Sheldon Cooper pass Sheldon Cooper

last morsel is called the greni piece and it is reserved for the most important and valued member of the group thank you all for this high honor I've seen pictures of your mother keep eating CER check it out I bought an engage locomotive half the size of ho look fits in my mouth sounds like you had a great night I am how was yours not bad I had a lot more fun with Amy than I thought I would what exactly do you mean by that turns out she really knows how to help a guy loosen up and have a good time although truth be told my groins a little worse for wear why'd you do that to send a message she is not for you what not for you one moment I'm conducting an experiment with Dungeons and dragon's dice yes from here on in I've decided to make Ultra trivial decisions with a throw of the dice that's freeing up my mind to do what it does best Enlighten and Amaze page 14 item seven so what's for dinner a side of corn suckatash interesting um Howard can I see you for a minute please I don't want to show any more of your friends how I can fit in the booster seats uh no that's not it just come with me please let's see what I'll be washing that suckatash down with a picture of margaritas do you really want that that's the great thing it doesn't matter my mind is freed up to think about more important things what's it thinking about now hamburgers and lemonade mustache is looking good there Sheldon don't thank me thank the dice they told me what percentage of my face to shave why are you still doing this because it's working in the past few weeks unburdened by trivial decisions I've co-authored two papers in notable peer-reviewed journals and I'm close to figuring out why the Large Hadron Collider has yet to isolate the higs Bon particle you left out got chafed testicles because you no longer wear Underpants the dice giveth and the dice taketh away next to the dungeon is a moss covered door you managed to open it only to find yourself face to face with a hideous foul smelling moss covered ogre what do you do I say hey Ma what's for dinner 17 the ogre is amused by your joke and allows you to pass you by the bye I liked it too how go the wedding plans Howard great spent 5

the authenticity of your restorante okay I'm out of here un momento oh For Heaven's Sake now you're being deliberately stupid where are you going I'm having dinner with PR up rajes I think Howard's going to be there you want to join us but tonight's Thursday on Thursdays everybody comes over here and has pizza or a reasonable fact simile prepared by someone claiming to be Luigi but who sounds suspiciously like Jackie Chan can we make a onetime exception for tonight we could we could also stop using the letter M but I think that idea is is guided and aonic just come with me to Rogers Well I don't want to go to a party it's not a party it's the same group of people who hang out here hanging out over there I'm sorry but five people eating and chatting is a party how come it's not a party when we do it here because we don't throw parties I don't know what to tell you Sheldon I'm going to see Pria everyone's over there are you coming or not no sir and do you know why in a word tradition every Thursday night for the last eight years you and I and our friends have gathered here in this very spot to break bread covered with cheese and sauce discuss the issues of the day and yes share a laugh or two but I I guess our Rich Heritage means nothing to you I guess you're right see you later wait Leonard wait what am I going to do for dinner come with me to Raj's and eat there well I can't do that what if he serves haggus and blood pudding I really doubt that's what he'll serve but what if he does I'll be obliged to dine on liver and lung stuffed in a sheep stomach and frankly blood pudding is essentially the same thing I don't know why he's serving both what do you want to do do you want to come with me or do you want to sit here alone no I'll go to your haggus party I'm telling you this is adness this is utter and complete adness hi hey what you got there oh I grabbed a sandwich of the food truck out front well now hold on tonight is Friday and I believe you know what that means and my fun Young Life took a drastic turn somewhere no but yeah no that means it's Chinese food night yeah and you have Chinese food so eat it but I can smell your pastrami we can all hear your complaining so no one's happy it does smell good it is I had one the other day what is happening everybody's supposed to be eating Chinese food well actually I believe the Chinese may have invented the sandwich their dish rujia ma literally means meat between bread so looks like all of us including Penny are eating Chinese food except for you Sheldon you're eating crew I'm sorry I think you're forgetting that the sandwich was invented by John montigue the Earl of Sandwich oh the truck's called pearl of sandwich now I get it all right that smells too good I got to get one of those and I think you're forgetting that there are written documents of meat between bread being eaten in China during the Tang Dynasty you know what I'll go with you and then maybe we just go home I think you're defining bread very Loosely if we go down that road where does it end I would say when we go to bed but you talk in your sleep I don't want to get into this with you right now we'll talk about this when I'm asleep I don't want to talk about it when you're asleep how come we can't talk about it now because I'm eating now fine how's your Mushu no it's great w look at that oh oh maybe the Chinese did invent the sandwich I guess you were right too bad no one's around to hear it h Greek food on pizza night this is the most delightfully cruel thing we've done to Sheldon since we left that fake message from Steven Hawking on his voicemail seriously I wish to discuss your theories of black meet me at the Randy's donut by the a at 2 a.m. what is that you're eating tonight is pizza night I'd like to refer that to my attorney according to what I see here Thursday nights are Fran con's pizza night yes and when Fran conies went out of business we switched to grazianos that's interesting can you just switch restaurants like that Priya a good question Howard turns out you can't according to the document you drew up Sheldon the selection of a new takeout restaurant requires public hearings and a 60-day comment period were those criteria met no this is Greek food Leonard you hate Greek food not as much as you [Applause] fine I'm nothing if not adaptable I got you the lamb kebab thank you if you think about it Greek food isn't that far from Italian food they share a spice poet and what a civilization is the Greeks they gave us science democracy and little cubes of charred meat that tastes like sweat boy seems like forever since the four of us have been out to eat you know just the guys oh God yes we get it you have a girlfriend now little jealous are we no I'm not jealous all right I'd kill a hobo if it would get me laid now can we order oh dear lord they redid the menu so what it's the same food oh is it look at this General so's chicken is no longer listed under Specialties it's now under chicken so yes General so not so the chicken so the question so so why is it no longer a specialty did the chef lose confidence in the dish or himself and look over here shrimp in mobster sauce what is mobster sauce it's obviously a typo perhaps or perhaps this restaurant's now a front for organized crime for all we know the mobster sauce contains actual chunks of deceased Mobsters no no no no I think it just means it's the kind of sauce that Mobsters like it doesn't mean any of that it's a typo you know what let's just get a pizza a good idea we'll go to corly own sure no Mobsters there G penny thanks for buying us dinner MH yeah what's the occasion no no occasion just felt like getting some Chinese cha from my peeps do you remember to ask for the chicken with broccoli to be diced not shredded yes even though the menu description specifies shredded yes brown rice not white yes you stop the Korean grocery and get the good hot mustard yes did you pick up the little sodium soy sauce from the market yes good see how it's Don Leonard so what do we got going on tonight huh playing Halo watching Battle Star drop some Mentos and D Coke you want to watch Battle Star what can I say I got my geek on boys no no PMS is different thank God you're home I need help what's wrong I just got a call back to audition for CSI to play a hooker who gets killed oh I'd watch that but my car is in the shop and I have to be at Universal in 45 minutes okay well I'll take you oh you're a lifesaver I'll run lines with you in the car great and afterward I'll take you all out for Chinese oh actually that's okay we alreadying Chinese food right here they're gone Penny they can't hear you I cannot believe they are letting her just use them like that I me anything she wants they go panting after her like train dogs you know that just last week she had Howard drive all the way to her uncle's house in Orange County to pick up her TV you want T Leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend apples and oranges here Sheldon I'm telling you that girl is a user skating through life on her looks taking advantage of innocent weak-willed men getting auditions for stupid network shows it just creams my corn may I interject something here please you got the wrong mustard oh lard I don't mean to alarm you but the Chinese food smells funny that's because it's barbecue but it's Chinese food night I picked it you're the one who told me to stop being such a satisficer all the time what I did not I just pointed out that you were one it's what I like best about you well that and those little notes you leave in my lunch I leave those well that's disappointing I already know that you heart me now I don't know if Leonard does well this is what we're having for dinner you can eat it or not I don't care I guess that answers the heart question it's fine we'll have barbecue oh of course I am nothing if not flexible I am sure that at some point in the 3,000 year history of the Chinese Empire a Cavalry man crossing the goby desert was forced by hunger to eat his own horse and roasted over a campfire hence Chinese barbecue let's eat you I'm sorry I didn't watch the news today has the whole world gone mad it's my house I'm tired of being told where I can and can't sit you did this Amy grab your meat we're leaving in a huff I'm sorry if I don't go now it's not a huff don't take this the wrong way but that was even more exciting the sex don't take this the wrong way but yes it was I'm sorry we cannot do this without walowitz we can't order Chinese food without walowitz let me walk you through it our standard order is the steam dumpling appetizer General SE chicken beef with broccoli shrimp with lobster sauce and vegetable lowain do you see the problem I see a problem our entire order is predicated on four dumplings and four Entre divided amongst four people so we'll just order three Entre fine what do you want to eliminate and who gets the extra dumpling we could cut it into thirds then it's no longer a dumpling once you cut it open it is at best a very small Open Face Sandwich oh hi fellas oh was your annoying little friend who thinks he speaks Mandarin he's putting his needs ahead of the Collective good where he comes from that's punishable by death I come from Sacramento can we get an order of dumplings but with three instead of four no substitutions this isn't a substitution it's a reduction okay no reductions fine uh bring us three orders of dumplings that's 12 will'll each have four well that works no if we fill up on dumplings we need to eliminate another entree no eliminations if we have extra we'll just take the leftovers home and divide it how I'm telling you we cannot do this without walowitz walowitz is with his new girlfriend if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fork have you seen Penny eat Chinese food she uses a fork and she double dips her egg rolls we don't order egg rolls exactly but we'd have to if she was here can we please make a decision not only that children Starving in India there's an Indian starving right here there's an idea why don't we just go out for Indian food no you are nice boys tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to bring you the four dumplings when I'm walking over to the table maybe I get bumped one of the dumplings fall to the floor no

to choose between sex and Halo 3 as far as I know sex has not been upgraded to include high def graphics and enhanced weapon systems you're right all sex has is nudity orgasms and human contact my

works now if we fill up on dumplings we need to eliminate another entree no eliminations if we have extra we'll just take the leftovers home and divide it how I'm telling you we cannot do this without without walowitz walowitz is with his new girlfriend if you had let me invite Penny then you would have had your fourth have you seen Penny eat Chinese food she uses a fork and she double dips her egg rolls we don't order egg rolls exactly but we'd have to if she was here can we please make a decision not only the children Starving in India there's an Indian starving right here there's an idea why don't we just go out for Indian food oh you are nice boys tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to bring you the four dumplings when I'm walking over to the table maybe I get bumped one of the dumplings fall to the floor no one has to know I'll know how about soup yeah we can always divide soup what about the wons just saying you can take the damn plastic off the couch once in a while why so you and Howard can hump on it ladies ladies I'm sure there's a middle ground shut up Howard you guys talk I'm going to take my scooter out for a little spin you happy you drove your own son out of the house why don't you stop fting in when you don't bu what you guys doing here it's Halo night he's not a man he's a PT and don't you take that tone with me you gold digger what did you call me you heard me and I'll tell you something else you're barking up the wrong tree cuz as long as you're around Howard is out of the will you know what I got better offers I'm out of here that's right go back to babyon you HOA so Halo night huh there any questions yeah what the hell was that any other questions Dr Sheldon Cooper Here I Am the lead author of this particular paper thank you and you sir you have completely skipped over the part where I was was walking through the park and I saw these children on a marry go around what started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gases like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero I didn't skip it it's just an anecdote it's not science oh oh I see it was the Apple falling on Newton's head was that just an anecdote you are not Isaac Newton no no that's true gravity would have been apparent to me without the Apple you canot possibly be that arogant you continue to underestimate me my good man look if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me as I explained repeatedly unlike you I don't need validation from lesser Minds no offense really so why did you come because I knew you'd screwed this up maybe I didn't go to college when I was 11 like you maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room no offense and and I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation so you admit you're an egotist yes my name is Dr Leonard hoffstead and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you but he's worse okay that is it stop it you cannot blow up my head with your mind then I'll settle for an aneurism stop it you hit me you saw that he hit me trying to blow up my head so it was working it wasn't it was not you are a nutcase oh s about that heads up people in the front row this is a Splash Zone not stop it quit it is this usually how these physics things go more often than you think ner Sheldon why is this letter in the trash well was always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter but aam's Razer would suggest that that someone threw it out it's from The Institute for experimental physics they want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference and Bose Einstein condensates I know I read it before I threw it out okay if I may drill down to the Bedrock of my question why did you throw it out because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgmental strangers who wouldn't recognize true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech which if I were there it would be I don't know Sheldon those topical conference on Bose Einstein condensates parties are legendary forget the parties forget the parties what a nerd are there any other honors I've gotten that I don't know about did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it Leonard please don't take this the wrong way but the day you win a Nobel Prize is the day I began my research on the drag coefficient of Tassels on flying carpets the only thing missing from that insult was your mama I got one hey Leonard your mama's research methodology is so flawed shut up Howard Sheldon we have to do this no we don't we have to take in nourishment expel waste and inhale enough oxygen to keep ourselves from dying everything else is optional okay let me put it this way I'm doing it you can't I'm the lead author come on the only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the that it was my idea not to put too fine a point on it but I was throwing you a bone you're welcome excuse me I design the experiment to prove the hypothesis it doesn't need proving what so the entire scientific Community is just supposed to take your word they're not supposed to but they should all right I don't care what you say I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings and I forbid it you forbid it if I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is so you admit that it's our work no once again I'm throwing you a bone and once again you are welcome oh no he didn't what is it I'm uncomfortable having been included in your lie to Penny what was I supposed to say you could have told her the truth that would have hurt her feelings is that a relevant Factor yes then I suppose you could have agreed to go and what would I have said afterwards I would suggest something to the effect of singing is neither an appropriate vocation nor avocation for you and if you disagree I'd recommend you have a CAT scan to look for a tumor pressing on the cognitive processing centers of your brain I couldn't say that I would have to say you were terrific and I can't wait to hear you sing again why it's the social protocol it's what you do when you have a friend who's proud of something they really suck at I was not aware of that well now you are oh all right Leonard yes when we played chess earlier you were terrific and I can't wait to play you again good night oh dear God Leonard Leonard I'm sick I'm sick Leonard Leonard Leonard Leonard my comforter fell down in my sinus is hurt when I bend over letter ow hey lit where are you I'm at work at 6:30 in the morning yes on Sunday yes why they asked me to come in I didn't hear the phone ring they texted me well as I predicted I am sick my fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2: a.m. and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate no kidding nope not only that it has shifted from clear to milky Gra green Howard it's the phone I know it's the phone Ma I hear the phone well who's calling at this ungodly hour I don't know well ask them why they're calling at this ungodly hour how can I ask them when I'm talking to you hello how it's Leonard code milky green dear Lord not milky green so Dennis how long have you been in America year and a half no kidding you speak English really well so do you except for your tendency to incenses with prepositions what are you talking about that he's not wrong all right and this is my office is this part of the tour nope goodbye come on Sheldon we've hardly shown him anything all right this is my desk these are my books this is my door please close it behind you goodbye looks like you're doing work in Quantum Loop Corrections Keen observation goodbye you see where he went wrong don't you Leonard yeah get him out come on Dennis I'll show you the rec center they've got Nautilus equipment do I look like I lift weights not heavy ones it's startling to me you haven't considered a l Ren and VAR in your field Theory approach you think I haven't considered it you really think I haven't considered it have you considered it get him out Leonard come on Dennis I'll show you the radiation lab wow you want the Stevenson award yes in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it really how old 14 and a half you were the youngest person ever to win it it's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror isn't it here's the problem with teleportation lay it on me assuming a device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location and trans MIT that pattern to a distant location for reassembly you would not have actually transported the individual you would have destroyed him in one location and recreated him in another how about that personally I would never use a transporter because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the old Sheldon no he would be exactly the same that is a problem so you see it too okay so we now have a socially awkward genius in a room full of attractive age appropriate women all he has to do now is hook up with one of them anyone else see the flaw on this plan okay we cannot leave this to chance let's pick a girl and figure out how to get her together with Dennis okay how about that one uh-uh I know the type cheerleader student counsel goes out with the jocks won't even look at anybody in the gifted program and if after 2 years of begging she does agree to go out with you it turns out to be a setup and you're in the backseat of your mom's car with your pants off while the whole football team laughs at you are you crying no I have allergies okay U oh hey I about her sure he wants to spend a couple years doing her homework while she drinks herself into a stoer with non-fat White Russians you're the one holding her head out of the toilet while she's puking and telling you she wishes more guys were like you and then she gets in a Cornell because you wrote her essay for her and you drive up to visit her one weekend and she acts like she doesn't even know you okay so not her either could I have everyone's attention please what a wonderful occasion this is and how fortunate that it should happen to fall on take your daughter to work day we're here to welcome Mr Dennis Kim to our little family welcome Dennis Kim Mr Kim was not only the valedictorian at Stanford University he is also the youngest recipient of the prestigious Stevenson award youngest till the cyborgs rise up and now without any further Ado let me introduce the man of the hour Mr Dennis Kim Dennis Dennis what would you like to tell us a little bit about your upcoming research oh no thanks I'm going to the mall with Emma uh the kid got a girl unbelievable did anyone see how he did it unbelievable components I built are on the International Space Station and I get a ticket for launching a rocket in the park I don't know if the ticket was so much for the launch as it was for you telling the policewoman you have to Frisk me I have another Rocket in My Pants hey look at that it's Dennis Kim wow I almost didn't recognize him you know I kind of feel bad about what we did to [Music] him yeah we really ruined his life screw him he was weak some guy is auctioning off a miniature time machine prop from the original film and no one is bidding on it a time machine from the movie The Time Machine no a time machine from Sophie's Choice boy Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie did you see it it's rough oh that's cool uhhuh it's only $800 yeah and that's my bid you bid $800 it was a Spur the- moment thing I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it there's only 30 seconds left in the auction do you have $800 not to blow on a miniature time machine well don't worry the way these things work is people wait until the last second to bid and then they swoop in and get it it's called sniping 15 seconds come on snipers 10 9 8 where are your snipers five snipe four snipe three snipe two snip one oh congratulations you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine you lucky duck I wonder why no one else bid this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia yeah I know I understand why no one else bid take him down he's got you sheld at this completely hey guys guys some of the other waitresses wanted me to ask you something oh it's called trestling it combines the physical strength of arm wrestle in with the mental agility of Tetris into the ultimate sport yeah that's terrific but what they wanted me to ask you is to cut it the hell out all right come on guys come on happy birthday to you we might as well stop it's a stalemate you're beating me in Tetris but you've got the upper body strength of a Keebler elf kebler elf I got your kebler Elf right here okay it's a stalemate

impulsive woman so how about it gee uh is it the waitress Penny what about her well I thought I saw your pupils dilate when you looked at her which unless you're a heroin addict points to sexual attraction I did have a poppy seed bagel for breakfast which could give a positive your intest for opiates but certainly not dilate my pupil so I guess there was no point in bringing it up you and the

missing something let's start again the movie is playing here at 720 here at 740 here at 810 and here at 8:45 all right these theaters have to be eliminated why they're state-ofthe-art digital projection 20 Channel surround sound yes but they have no icy machines despite my aggressive letter writing campaign I might add wa what about the multiplex here the seats are terrific they have Twizzlers instead of Red Vines no amount of lumbar support can compensate for that well it's going to take at least an hour to eat and I don't see a Sheldon approved restaurant approximate to a Sheldon approved theater we could eat off to the movie unacceptable the delay would result in tomorrow morning's bowel movement occurring at work hang on hang on there's a 711 here we smuggle Slurpees which are essentially ices in under a courts after having a Pleasant meal either here here or here wow I don't see how we missed that excuse me in what Universe are Slurpees ices that's how we missed it Shelton would you be prepared on a non-precedential basis to create an emergency ad hoc slurpie icy equivalency oh Leonard you know I can't do that okay I guess we only have one option yep I don't see anywhere around it bye Sheldon see you later dude they're right it was the only option your Facebook status update Leonard hofstead is in a relationship what no no that's not right oh man did you switch your status before she did speaking as an expert way to look needy seriously you went first after only two weeks that's bold it's not bold it's a mistake I didn't change my status well then who did I had no choice he cried in front of her you hacked my Facebook account oh it's hardly hacking when you use the same password for everything C are you insane now she's going to think I'm desperate you've destroyed destroyed this relationship and you want to know the worst part is you don't even understand what you did wrong because you can't conceive of something that you are not an expert in

much deliberation we've determined that a turtle is the ideal pet they don't shed fur uh they don't make noise for Halloween we can dress him as a cobblestone and if he ever goes berserk I know I can outrun him coincidentally that's also why I chose you as a roommate well congratulations who would have thought you two' be the first in our group to start a family that's what I said oh dear Lord oh

what constitutes an emergency that's ridiculous a bathroom emergency is self-explanatory is it if Leonard forgot to trim his nose here could he budge in while you were showering irrelevant Leonard doesn't trim his nose hair he thinks because he's short nobody can see up there my point is Sheldon the legal principle is ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not drafted in this case Leonard so much for count one but there's no but Sheldon that's how the law works schooled as for the shower capacity issue I cite addendum J when Sheldon show is second any and all measures shall be taken to ensure an adequate supply of hot water I believe this supersedes the occupancy issue superseded tonight is pizza night I'd like to refer that to my attorney according to what I see here

lavatory where did you hear that actually I read it wallo it's texted me like blue ice falling out of an airplane laboratory yep yeah I thought it was a pretty good one I gave him an LOL anyway it got me thinking now that you're unattached maybe we can revisit our previous attachment are you suggesting another bout of stress release no I'm all done with casual from now on I'm fully committed to the traditional relationship Paradigm really what changed it's hard to say I guess there's just a time in every woman's life when she gets tired of waking up on a strange food tone with a bunch of people she doesn't know yeah I can see how that would a bunch of people anyway I just figure it's time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you I'm flattered so how do you suggest we proceed your place will order Chinese you'll rent a movie artsy but accessible then light petting no coidus sounds fun I'll leave the details up to you I think it's better if you assume the maale role thank you that's very thoughtful all right call me when the two of you reach a natural stopping point I'd like to have a word if the word is peee just do it Leonard you're my friend and Friends support their friends apparently so I'm withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie thank you I will graciously Overlook the fact that she is an arrogant subpar scientist who actually believes Loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory you kids have fun hang on a second Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions in string theory I'm listening amuse me okay well for one thing we expect quanti SpaceTime to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colors Baler Dash matter clearly consists of tiny strings are you going to let him talk to me like that okay well there's a lot of Merit to both theories no there isn't only Loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes Sheldon don't make that noise it's disrespectful I should hope so it was a snort of derision you agree with me right Loop quantum gravity is the future of physics sorry Leslie I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy well I'm glad I found out the truth about about you before this one any further truth what truth we're talking about untested hypothesis it's no big deal oh it isn't really tell me Leonard how will we raise the children I I guess we wait until they're old enough and let them choose their own Theory we can't let them choose what are their children wait where are you going I'm sorry I could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice cream or ever get a good view of a parade but this this is a deal breaker look on the bright side what's the bright side only nine more months to Comic-Con yeah fellow Warriors this is sheldor the Conqueror we are about to enter ael's Fortress now this is a long run so let's do another

you Sheldon you're welcome point of inquiry why did you put your car key in the door lock why I'll tell you why because today I had an audition it took me 2 hours to get there I waited an hour for my turn and before I could even start they told me I look too Midwest for the part to Midwest what the hell does that even mean well the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and dramatic people they have a characteristic face of I mean Sheldon God you know I have been in La for almost 2 years now and I haven't gotten a single acting job I've accomplished nothing haven't gotten a raise

record the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is Jetpack hoverboard transporter Batmobile and then giant ant seriously you have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants what's with him perhaps he's at a sensitive point in his monthly cycle are you saying he's manring not literally but as far back as the 17th century scientists observed a

rematch the Wesley Crushers no not the Wesley Crushers the Wesley Crushers I don't get it Wesley Crusher was Will Wheaton's character on Star Trek still don't get it it's a blindingly clever play on words by appropriating his character's name and adding the S we imply that we'll be The Crushers of Wesley okay I'm sorry honey but the Wesley Crusher sounds like a bunch of people who like Wesley Crusher but no again it's not the Wesley Crushers it's the Wesley Crushers well if you wanted to mean you're crushing Wesley it would be the Wesley Crushers do you people even hear yourselves it's not

crazy I'm amazed that I'm holding them I'm not really hungry you realize that I'm not a particularly physical person I know now when I was little and people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up I'd always say a brain in a jar sure yeah but I want to be a good husband to you and intimacy is a part of that please put those down I'm just worried that if I don't schedule our bedroom Endeavors then I may not think about them and you'll grow cold and distant and seek solace in the arms of a heavily muscled long shoreman where would I find a long shoreman along the shore it's in the name Sheldon I could never be with anybody but you that's good to know I wouldn't want to fight a man who's brave enough to touch a fish how's this for a compromise make all the schedules you want just don't tell me about them excellent I'll create an algorithm that'll generate a pseudo random schedule and do you know why it won't be a true random schedule because the generation of true random numbers remains an un solved problem in computer science come with me where are we going to the hotel room and when we get there I'm going to need you to say that again except naked remember yesterday when we were talking about having kids someday yeah well what if it wasn't someday oh my God oh my God are you pregnant no no no no no no no no no no no no no no so no what I meant was what if what if we didn't have kids ever I mean our life is so great why would we want to change that sure sure sure and I guess it would be hard raising kids in the The Loft you never told me you wanted wait don't be mad I'm not mad why would I be mad there's nothing to be mad at you have to turn the thing I knew that hey Leonard I'm not mad astronaut Howard Joel wall kakar she thank you Raj that was a really nice introduction well it's from my heart so Howard you are in an elite group only 232 people have ever been on the International Space Station how does that make you feel honestly lucky most astronauts have to train their whole lives I was just in the right place at the right time oh please luck had nothing to do with it you people need to know how impressive this man is he was up there because he's the only one qualified to to install a piece of equipment that he designed thanks but if you want to talk impressive this guy right here discovered a planetary object outside the Kyper belt he worked on the ma Rover he helped launch the New Horizon space probe he went to space in a Russian rocket and I was scared the whole time and I was scared for you but also proud wow I don't think you've ever said that to me before I should have I I'm going to say it again I'm proud of you you're my best friend and I love you all Raj I love you too what is happening bring it in Spaceman you've been cleared for landing can you believe these are you crying oh look how cute you were Amy please of course I was cute look how I turned out hello Sheldon hello Sheldon if you're watching this

Russian paper that seems to disprove super a cemetry are you sure yeah uh Howard translated it so sorry Sheldon are are you all right oh yes of course thank you for telling us Leonard I'm sure that wasn't easy I guess we don't need this anymore this all my fault I should have I should have just trusted her so you're saying you still want to get married fine then I'll call her parents and we'll straighten this whole thing out I don't think she wants to marry me and honestly she deserves someone better Rajesh you need to stop being so hard on yourself you're a good man wow you've never told

f5u1ruhNyA0,2024-06-03T14:00:27Z,Memorable Bernadette Moments (Season 4) | The Big Bang Theory,Absalon hath kissed her Nea Nicholas is scalded in the to this tale is done and God save all the RO what the hell was that bernardette dared me to tell a dirty story The Miller's tale by choser is the dirtiest story I know it would have been hidden in sock drawers if people in the 14th century had worn socks I thought it was pretty spicy especially the part where he kisses her nethera you might not like it as much if you knew what nether yaa meant hint if one cares about hygiene one ought not be kissing it okay my turn Kenny Truth or Dare truth why are you still hanging out with Leonard so much even though you broke up with him oh that's an excellent question for two people who claim to be no longer pair bonded you spend an inordinate amount of time in each other's company yeah dare I don't believe the rules allow for an ex poost facto option change yeah okay look just because we're not seeing each other anymore doesn't mean we can't be friends I mean Leonard's a great guy then why did you terminate your relationship with him I don't know he got really serious and I wasn't ready for it interesting how will you react if in the future you become ready for it and Leonard is unavailable because another woman has realized that he is to use your words a great guy you can only ask one question that one you know what I don't want to play anymore well I'm not sure how this is scored but I believe we may have won been more than years since I've even kissed a girl what about that hookup at Comic Con you told me about no grow up I was lying a lie all the time nobody wants to kiss me poor poor thing Raj you have to know you're a wonderful man there are a lot of girls out there who want to kiss you where you just have to look [Music] [Applause] well this was fun my God Glen great to see you are you here for the conference yeah I'm doing a global warming panel oh good for you oh Glenn is my boyfriend Howard nice to meet you hi ow hi you're a lucky man Bernie's a great gal yes Bernie sure is well I got a run the panel's tomorrow morning it's called remembering snow look back I'll try to catch it oh great bye bye hey Bernie yeah please tell me he's your gay cousin no he was one of my professors in college oh well that's a relief then we went out for a year come on let's check in so we can take that nap no it's not necessarily proportional shut up so this Glenn guy you say you went out with him for like a year do we really need to talk about my old boyfriend now oh I guess not what is he like 64 65 67 probably has a hard time finding a suit that fits is something bothering you no it's just what I'm just thinking if you had sex with that guy I mean there's nothing I can do here that will make any kind of impact hard it's not a contest I love you I want to be with you yeah great love you too but if it were a contest I wouldn't have a chance right you can't think that way yep loser Lord stop it sorry I just never figured that a guy like me going out with a girl like you would ever have to compete with a guy like that wait a minute a girl like me what's that mean are you saying you don't think I'm hot enough to go out with a guy like Glenn no no I'm saying exactly the opposite I'm too hot to go out with a guy like Glenn yeah let's go with that all right and we'll begin with opening remarks Miss roson Kowski would you like to start us off by discussing your assessment of science's responsibility to society sure I think all branches of science have to move cautiously these days it's not just giant nuclear weapons that can destroy the world as a microbiologist I can tell you even the tiniest organisms can still tear you a new one interesting I think what you might need to know about my colleague is that though she claims her field of interest is Tiny organisms she certainly has spent her fair share of time around what we can assume was pretty massive Weaponry I think Mr walowitz needs to keep in mind that the past is the past but he should know that I am the kind of girl who could get all the giant missiles she wants Dr kraal would you care to join the conversation certainly I'd like to raise two points number one I think they are talking about penises and number two these mimosas are kicking my little brown ass I'd like to kick your little brown ass what did I do oh I don't know maybe when you walk into a hotel room and you see a guy getting back together with his girlfriend you should consider doing something other than crawling into the adjoining bed I did you said no Bridget Jones we weren't getting back together it was a one-time thing excuse me we're not taking comments or questions from the audience just yet oh shut up Sheldon all right why don't we see if we can bring this back to topic let me ask you something Bernie I guess not how would you feel if you met my ex-girlfriend and she was like Angelina Jolie oh come on Howard be realistic what I'm not hot enough for Angelina Jolie I'd like to we in here no all right why don't we open it up to Q&A from the audience yeah I have a question is there anybody who can get me the hell out of here and back to Los Angeles tonight I'm driving back to LA tonight Penny that's Glenn Glenn that's Penny no okay Raj I know you've been avoiding me and Howard and I'm not leaving until you tell me what's going on inside that little head of [Music] yours like the wild elephant I am jumpering my love for you like a hidden flower my sweet fragrance

hypoallergenic detergent no better put it on the list if you wash my underwear with regular soap I get little red bumps on myus wait a second I'm doing your laundry well honey it's not going to do itself oh before I forget tomorrow morning you're driving me to the dentist I have to take you you don't have to take me you get to take me oh wait a minute are you telling me your mother usually takes you to the dentist it's not weird there's lots of kids there with their moms I can't believe this what it's fun if I have no cavities afterwards we go for a treat all right Howard let's get something straight right now I'm not going to be your mother whoa whoa whoa where did that come from last weekend priia took Leonard rollerblading at the beach can you believe that I feel like I'm supposed to say that but I don't have enough information I am the one who spent two years trying to get him to even go to the beach in the first place he was so phobic about stepping on medical waste I had to carry him to the water I took Howard to the beach once he almost burst into flames like a vampire so what's the thanks I get for turning Leonard into quality boyfriend material I have to tiptoe around his new girlfriend I think you're on oh that [Music]

cuz it's not carved in stone no 6:30 is great I'll get my chisel why to carve the okay I'll see you 6:30 how come you didn't go to work today I'm taking a sabatical because I won't cow mediocre Minds so you got canned huh theoretical physicists do not get canned but yeah maybe it's all for the best you know I always say when one door closes another one opens no it doesn't not unless the two doors are connected by relays or there are motion sensors involved no no I me or the first door closing creates a change of air pressure that acts upon the second door never mind Slow Down slow down please slow down we're fine you're not leaving yourself enough space between cars oh sure I am no no let me do the math for you this car weighs let's say £4,000 now add 140 for me 120 for you 120 oh I'm sorry did I insult you is your body mass somehow tied to yourself worth well yeah interesting anyway that gives us a total weight of let's say 4,400 lb let's say 4390 fine we're traveling forward at good Lord 51 mil an hour now let's assume that your brakes are new in the calipers are aligned still by the time we come to a stop we'll be occupying the same space as that Buick in front of us an impossibility that nature will quickly resolve into death mutilation and oh look they built a new putt putt course this is great look at me I'm in the real world of ordinary people just living their ordinary colorless work a day lives thank you no thank you thank you ordinary person hey you want to hear an interesting thing about tomatoes uh no no not really listen didn't you say you needed some eggs yes but anyone who knows anything about the Dynamics of bacterial growth knows to pick up their refrigerated Foods on the way out of the supermarket oh okay well maybe you should start heading on out then no this is fun oh the thing about tomatoes and I think you'll really enjoy this is they're shelved with the vegetables but they're technically a fruit interesting isn't it no I mean what you find enjoyable oh boy what now well there's some value to taking a multivitamin but the human body can only absorb so much what you're buying here are the ingredients for very expensive urine well maybe that's what I was going for well then you'll want some manganese that was fun maybe tomorrow we can go to one of those big warehouse stores oh I don't know Sheldon it's going to take me a while to recover from all the fun I had today are you sure there are a lot of advantages to buying in bulk I for example I noticed that you purchase your tampons one month supply at a time what what think about it it's a product that doesn't spoil and you're going to be needing them for at least the next 30 Years you want me to buy 30 years worth of tampons well 30 35 when did your mother go into menopause okay there you go Leonard one tequila sunrise thank you you know this drink is a wonderful example of how liquids with different specific gravities interact in a cylindrical container thank

New Delhi are you talking to me is there another penny you I had such plans I had dreams I was going to be the Indra Gandhi of particle astrophysics but with a penis of course it's amazing ever since I was a little boy my father wanted me to be a gynecologist like him how can I be a gynecologist I can barely look a woman in the eye you know what I'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer it's time for Showdown somebody give me a computer with a webcam okay sweetie I think that's the grasshopper talking and it's about to tell my parents that I'm not riding an elephant down the aisle with Lita Gupta okay calm down no one can make you get married why don't you just meet this girl and see what happens haven't you been listening to me I cannot talk to women um Raj no no let's see how long it takes him Raj Penny you say you can't talk to women but you've been talking to me and now we'll never know right I I I am talking to you hello Penny how are you go tonight I have to [Applause] goonight what the hell is that I don't know but if cats could sing they'd hate it too will take my hey guys hi where are you going what we just had to mail some letters and throw away some chicken [Laughter] he'll never guess what has happened oh I give up I don't guess as a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation although as I'm saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot what was that believe it or not personal growth what happened all right remember when I auditioned for that Workshop production of rent but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why I have a conclusion based on an observation no you don't no he doesn't well the girl they picked to play Mimi she dropped out and they asked me to replace her congratulations what a lucky break it's not a big deal just a one night showcase but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so you never know I think I know no you don't he doesn't it's this Friday at 8 you guys want to come no because uh Friday we are attending a symposium on molecular patronum I think that's a week from Tuesday at 6 no it's this Friday at 8 oh too bad well I got to get to rehearsal see you guys see you let's go out hang on the sensor's picking up something turn your head back you rat bastard told you the sensor would work why you deliberately stuck me with Sheldon come on I had to you see what he's like Betty Betty I'm hungry uh it's okay sweetie good news let home no here you go good luck bye wait wait but I'm hungry wait Penny take me with you hold him there a little longer look I've done my best but he wants to go home and I don't know how to stop them okay how about this you keep them there a little longer and when you get to the party I'll point out which of my friends are easy don't toy with me woman I got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem I got a girl who punishes her father by sleeping around and an alcoholic who's two tequila shots away from letting you wear her like a hat thy will be done we going to see you Saturday uh I don't think so why not I don't celebrate my birthday shut up yeah you do well it's no big deal it's just the way I was raised my parents focused on celebrating achievements and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them that's so silly it's actually based on very sound theories his mother published a paper on it well what was it called I hate my son and that's why he can't have cake it was obviously effective Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas he'd be a little better at it thank you well I love birthdays waking up to Mom's special French toast breakfast wearing the birthday king crown playing laser tag with all my friends yeah see that's what kids should have actually that was last year so you really never had a birthday party no but it was okay I mean when I was little I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind and surprise me with a party like this one birthday I came home for My Cello lesson and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front when I got to the door I could hear people whispering and I could smell German chocolate cake which is my favorite and uh it turns out my grandfather had died oh my God that that's terrible well it was kind of like a birthday party I got to see all my cousins and there was cake so that's the saddest thing I've ever heard you think go ahead tell her about your senior prom so would you get the birthday boy well Raj got him an awesome limited edition dark knight sculpture based on Alex Ross's definitive Batman and I got him this amazing autograph copy of the Fineman lectures on physics nice I got him a sweater okay okay well he might like that I've seen him get chilly uh Sheldon I didn't see your present that's because I didn't bring one why not don't ask the entire institution of gift giving makes no sense too late let's say that I go out and I spend $50 on you it's a laborious activity because I have to imagine what you need whereas you know what you need now I could simplify things just give you the $50 directly and then you could give me $50 on my birthday and so on until one of us dies leaving the other one old and $50 rich and I ask you is it worth it told you not to ask well Sheldon you're his friend friends give each other presents I accept your premise I reject your conclusion try telling him it's a non-optional social convention what just do it it's a non-optional social convention ah Fair enough he came with a [Music] manual I'm back I'm sorry I yelled at you it's not your fault what happened well I went over to Mike's to make up with him yeah no I know that part but he had already moved on already that was quick that's what I said to the woman who had her legs wrapped around his neck oh Penny I am so sorry how could he do that well you know you did throw an 80 gig iPod yeah no how could he do that I swear to God I am done with guys like that you know Macho with the perfect body and the hair and the money yeah that must get old quick you know just once I would like to go out with someone who is nice and honest and who actually cares about me what about me what about you what what about if you went out with me are you asking me out um yes I am asking you out wow I was just going off your comment about the nice guy no I know honest totally so but it's no big deal yes yes what yes I will go out with you really yeah why not I mean what do I have to lose yeah that's the spirit in 1935 Irwin schroen in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed vial of poison that will break open at a random time now since no one knows when or if the poison has been released until the box is opened the cat can be thought of is both alive and dead I'm sorry I don't get the point of course you don't get it I haven't made it yet you have to be psychic to get it and there's no such thing as psychic show them what's the point just like Schrodinger's cat your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad it is only by opening the box that you'll find out which it is okay so you're saying I should go out with Leonard no no no no no no let me start again in 1935 trou you guys mind if I start um penny that's where I sit sit next to me no I sit there what's the difference what's the difference here we go in the winter that seat

the weight of its own exoskeleton and for the record the appropriate ranking of cool modes of transportation is Jetpack hoverboard transporter Batmobile and then giant ant seriously you have nothing better to do than sit around and discuss the possibility of giant ants what's with him perhaps he's at a sensitive point point in his monthly cycle are you saying he's manstrating not literally but as

would have been 2 and a half if they ordered the sule when they sat down based on the geometric progression his relationship with Stephanie should have ended after 20 minutes yes I'm aware of the math y equals 27 days over 12 to the nth the issue remains how do we circumvent his inevitable rejection well if you want to guarantee his appeal to Stephanie your best bet would be to kill all the other men on the planet I'll tell you what you shouldn't do don't Spritz them with that body spray from the commercial where the women undress when they smell it that doesn't work at all no matter how much

31 pages enumerates iterates and codifies the rights and responsibilities of Sheldon Lee Cooper here and after known as the boyfriend and Amy Farah Fowler here and after known as the girlfriend it's so romantic Mutual indemnification always is why don't you start perusing while I set up my notary stamp section five handholding handholding is only allowed under the following circumstances a either party is in danger of falling off a cliff precipice or ledge B either party is deserving of a hearty handshake after winning a Nobel Prize C moral support during flu shots seems a bit restrictive yeah feel free to retain a lawyer what to spend some time playing the new Star Wars game this weekend I don't know I kind of promis myself I'd get off the computer be more physically active get some exercise you're about to walk up three flights of stairs good point I'm in you know what would be great let's do it like the old days you talking gaming Marathon yeah start Saturday morning go 48 Hours sleeping bags junk food I turn off our phone so our moms can't call it would be like our World of Warcraft party a few years ago when the neighbors called the cops on us they called the cops because of the smell they thought we were dead we were badass back in the day all right let's do it 48 Hours of Star Wars gaming it's on like aler on hey Sheldon clear your weekend starting Saturday Morning Star Wars marathon movies or video games or board games or trading card games or Legos or dress up or comic books or dramatic readings of novelizations yes to all we are going to play the

just tell her I can't come she'll be disappointed if we don't show up she's 93 she won't be disappointed for very long now hang on I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement I made a written request 72 hours in advance check the tire pressure on the car I even contacted the Centers for Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County FYI it's none Amy the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way you use it to get your way I use it to get the right way the fact that the right way is also my way is a happy coincidence you gave me your word you're coming with me well Mrs Sheldon yeah well who wants to spend the whole weekend running around a bunch of pretend planets battling madeup monsters that's for babies yeah but it's got lights please Amy it's got lightsabers Sheldon this place is so romantic oh I'm glad you like it Raj picked it out when you see him tell him I say thank you tell him yourself youo over here I don't understand what's he doing here I invited him on our date Sheldon that's not okay yes it is there's a loophole in the relationship agreement you found a loophole sorry I started without you I'm a little nervous it's been a long time since I've been on a date can't believe I bleached my mustache for this if she go to my girl she'll knock out those side bus for free you know Amy I don't even think you and I have had a real conversation let's use tonight to to get to know each other a little better you start go home I don't understand Sheldon how

you you do yes you're my ride Sheldon you either say something meaningful and from the heart or you and I are done all right please Amy when I look in your eyes and you're looking back in mine Everything feels not quite normal Al because I feel stronger and weaker at the same time I feel excited and at the same time terrified the truth is I don't know what I feel except I know what kind of man I want to be Sheldon that was beautiful I should hope so that's from the first Spider-Man movie I'll take it good now I assume we're splitting the check Amy Amy all right funeral Amy hello Sheldon I'm not allowed to wear my Silver Surfer necktie you can wear a bath robe I think I'm too sick to go to the funeral you're sick you poor kid well see you Sheldon aren't you going to take care of me me no no I'm not that kind of doctor but our relationship agreement clearly states that when one of us is sick the other must take care of them oh I see the confusion no the intent behind that Clause was to force you to take care of me when I'm Ill when you're feeling better you'll think that's funny never mind good night shelda Amy Amy Amy I made a commitment in writing to comfort you in times like this and additionally you are my girlfriend and I care about your well-being thank you Sheldon you're welcome now let's get this over with you'd be upset if you saw Amy out with someone else can't happen we have an ironclad relationship agreement which precludes her from physical contact with anyone other than me but you don't have sex with her either slick huh did you enjoy my lecture no and neither did our waiter wait if you're going to serve cornish game hin you should either be familiar with the history of Cornwall or be prepared to learn it it's hard to argue with that and I know because I saw a sad man with a Peppermill desperately try and fail hey how was dinner good I had cornish game H oh that poor waiter Sheldon how about tomorrow night we see the movie you guys are going out two nights in a row I missed a number of date nights while I was on my train trip and I'm contractually obligated to make them up under the terms of the relationship agreement that's so hot it's better than hot it's binding if you're free tomorrow night I'd love to have you join us on a double date a you are aware that a double date doesn't count as two dates oh well then come or don't I don't care okay I got to I I I I just I got to ask what makes you think that your relationship is so wonderful and ours isn't for starters we enjoy spending time together so do we and I've seen you guys ignore each other for hours doing totally different things it's called parallel play yeah toddlers do that not as well as we do you believe this guy has to be the best at everything so what why do you even care oh listen to them not even married and the honeymoon's over whatever you can't even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement if you've got a problem basing a relationship on a contract I'd like to tell you about 13 Plucky colonies that entered a relationship agreement called the US Constitution and it may not be cool to say so but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today it's a good thing I'm not wearing flag underwear right now cuz there's about to be a fire buckle up you're in for a cranky night according to the csil of the relationship agreement which you insisted upon were not allowed to pout or be moody on date night you know I just put that in because of uterus stuff well it applies to you too I was afraid you might bring this up so I have a work around there you go oh good you're here are you still fighting if you get divorced do I get two Christmases we're not getting divorced listen we realized Ed that uh we're facing some new challenges as a married couple yeah and there are a few things we need to stay on top of so we thought it would be useful I can't believe I am about to say this um would you please help us make a relationship agreement but one that's tailored to us okay we don't need a bathroom schedule although a rule about him texting me from in there might help with the romance what do you say I get to write a contract I say let's get this party of the first part [Laughter] started you really think that's funny it's in our agreement I have to laugh [Music]

your place will order Chinese you'll rent a movie artsy but accessible then light petting no coidus sounds fun I'll leave the details up to you I think it's better if you assume the maale role thank you that's very thoughtful all right call me when the two of you reach a natural stopping point I'd like to have a word if the word is peee just do it Leonard you're my friend and Friends support their friends apparently so I'm withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie thank you I will graciously Overlook the fact that she is an arrogant subpar scientist who actually believes Loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory you kids have fun hang on a second Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions in string theory I'm listening amuse me okay well for one thing we expect quanti SpaceTime to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colors Baler Dash matter clearly consists of tiny strings are you going to let him talk to me like that okay well there's a lot of Merit to both theories no there isn't only Loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes Sheldon don't make that noise it's disrespectful I should hope so it was a snort of derision you agree with me right Loop quantum gravity is the future of physics sorry Leslie I guess I prefer my space stringy not loopy well I'm glad I found out the truth about about you before this one any further truth what truth we're talking about untested hypothesis it's no big deal oh it isn't really tell me Leonard how will we raise the children I I guess we wait until they're old enough and let them choose their own Theory we can't let them choose what are their children wait where are you going I'm sorry I could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice cream or ever get a good view of a parade but this this is a deal breaker look on the bright side

I can't get the damn key out it's not surprising that Baldwin lock on your door uses traditional EDG mounted cylinders whereas the key for your Volkswagen uses a center cylinder system thank you Sheldon you're welcome point of inquiry why did you put your car key in the door lock why I'll tell you why because today I had an audition it took me 2 hours to get there I waited an hour for my turn and before I could even start they told me I look too Midwest for the part to Midwest what the hell does that even mean well the American Midwest was mostly settled by Scandinavian and dramatic people they have a characteristic face of what mean Sheldon God you know I have been in La for almost 2 years now and I haven't gotten a single acting job I've accomplished nothing haven't gotten a raise at

pure protein oh son of a  I believe the condensation on your Frozen Foods weaken the structural Integrity of the bag but returning to your key conundrum perhaps you should call a locksmith and have him open the door for you I did he said he'll get here when he gets here and you're frustrated because he phrased his reply in the form of a meaningless tautology no I am frustrated because I am a failure at everything and my breath smells like fly they're there would you prefer to wait in our apartment no Sheldon I'd rather sit on this freezing cold floor sobbing like a three-year-old all

04jPLP7txKo,2024-05-09T22:00:00Z,Memorable Mom Moments | The Big Bang Theory,it's out of order yes I can read the sign I'm just pondering the implications I think it implies that the elevator doesn't work again I can read the sign but the sign and the tape are covered with a layer of dust which indicates that the elevator has been nonfunctional for a significant amount of time which suggests either a remarkable paiv among the I assume 24 to 36 residents of this building based on the number of mailboxes and given typical Urban population density or a shared delusion of functionality you must be Leonard's mother oh I don't know if I must be but yes um I'm penny I'm his neighbor oh Dr Beverly hoffstead oh nice to meet you oh you're a handshaker interesting uh why don't you come with me I'll walk you to the apartment oh all right would you like to exchange pleasantries on the way yeah sure I guess all right you start okay you know I've always been curious what was Leonard like when he was little oh I think you mean young he's always been little right okay what was he like when he was young you'll have to be more specific oh um okay like five or six [Laughter] five oh well at that age he was well in mesed in what Freud would call the phallic stage of psychosexual development an outmoded theory of course but the boy did spend most of his waking hours with a tight grasp on his penis oh yeah Leonard mentioned you were a psychiatrist well that is one of my degrees my primary field is neuroscience oh well I'm an actress why what what do you mean why well there are studies that suggest that many who go into the Performing Arts suffer from an external locus of identity yeah I don't know what that means well it means you value yourself only as others value you which is often the result of unmet childhood emotional needs oh well I had a wonderful childhood tell me about it I know my dad wanted a boy I I just I tried being good at sports but I hated getting dirty and then I'm assuming you entered adolescence uh he called me Slugger until I got my first training bra and then he just stopped playing catch with me I wasn't Slugger anymore your mother's here if you want to have intercourse with that girl find out what kind of cologne her father wor good to see you mother Leonard rarely talks about his incredibly successful brother and sister please don't go there Howard I understand that unlike Leonard they're at the top of their respective Fields boy you suck well Leonard's younger brother Michael is a tenar law professor at Harvard and his sister just successfully grew a human pancreas in an adolescent Gibbon so she's close to curing diabetes why else would you grow a pancreas in a teenaged Gibbon wow you must be very proud why they're not my accomplishments I have to urinate why are you doing this you know the rules you brought your mom to work you must suffer that was fast oh the middle stall was occupied I'll have to try again later it's totally understandable in bladder voiding as in real estate it's location location location so wait wait wait Howard lives with his mother and Raj can't speak to women unless he's drunk go oh that's fascinating selective mutism is quite rare on the other hand an adult Jewish male living with his mother is so common it borders on sociological cliche it's just temporary I pay rent he lives in the same room where as bassinet was you know both selective mutism and an inability to separate from one's mother can stem from a pathological fear of women it might explain why the two of you have created an air sets homosexual marriage to satisfy your need for intimacy say what that's basically what I just said you brought your husband to work you know the rules how head to the door I'm busy I'm busy too you answer it I can't I'm on the to VI God's sake I don't need to hear that can you just say I'm busy I said I'm busy but that wasn't good enough for you you know what I hope it's one of those home invasion deals and they show me in the head well if it's a home Invader don't tell them I'm on the [Music] toilet there's no one there you're hearing things you crazy old lady so Howard have you and rajes finally summon the courage to express your latent homosexual feelings towards one another what no why not because we don't have Laten homosexual feelings toward one another I see no really I have a girlfriend now and where is she this evening she had to go out of town her grandmother died I see her grandmother died you honest to God Leonard tell her I have a girlfriend I don't know what you're talking about you don't know what I'm talking about tell her I have a girlfriend all right he has a girlfriend her name is bernardet she's working as a waitress but she's going to school to be a microbiologist I would keep in mind that the more passionately you stick to this construct the more you're hurting your partner you really think your lips in my ear is helping hi sorry I'm late oh glad you're here sit down I'll get you a plate mom you remember Penny oh yes the waitress SL actress with the unresolved father issues has he finally come to terms with his little Slugger growing breasts well he sent me a football and a catcher mitt for Christmas so I'm going to say no if it helps we're all good with your breast classic overcompensation oh speaking a father's lard that reminds me I'm divorcing yours what yes he was cheating on me no with some waitress from the University cafeteria can you believe it a waitress oh no offense dear no it sounded like a compliment when did this happen mhm well let's see Sheldon when did I leave Leonard's father September 22nd oh yes that's right the weekend after Leonard's dog died mit's dead she was old and blind Leonard what choice did we have I don't believe this why am I the last to know excuse me Leonard I am the one who's getting a divorce mity is the one who is dead why are you the one making a fuss you're right I'm

Charming how come you didn't tell me that you and father were getting a divorce how come you didn't tell me you had surgery how come you didn't tell me my dog died what I hear you saying is that you want a more intimate motherson relationship I do there it's late now go to bed I'm getting a warm feeling spreading through my heart that's the Del Taco why is Leonard softly banging his head against his bedroom door speaking of warm feelings come [Applause] here now I'd rather have the bus boy I honestly didn't believe Amy when she told me she had a boyfriend I assure you I am quite real and I'm having regular intercourse with your daughter what oh yes we are like wild animals in heat it's a wonder neither of us has been hurt Amy what is he saying you wanted me to have a boyfriend mother well here he is have to sign off now my Hunger for Sheldon is stirring in my loins oh yes it's time for me to make love to your daughter's vagina thank you Sheldon that went very well agreed Amy I find myself wondering if we should actually engage in Kus at least one time in our relationship Bazinga bedtime please show yourself out she's great huh she's a lovely girl cute as a button that's good to hear cuz I've got some news I hope it's good news because I've got nothing but disappointment in [Laughter] here bernardette and I are getting married Ma you too busy bearing down m ah oh my go M

actually big news on the Amy front she's been studying the neurobiology of addiction in lower animals she is this close to getting a starfish hooked on cocaine you have any idea what's going on with those two it's kind of like the Loch Ness monster maybe there's something there maybe there isn't we'll probably never know uh sometimes it's fun to creep yourself out thinking about it how are you doing on the young lady front I hear you're in some sort of a long-distance situation oh yeah it's raja's sister it's kind of tough she's in India also her parents aren't happy she's dating someone white oh that's a funny turn isn't it cuz you you never think about it going the other way well you can't force things you need to figure out if you're in a relationship or if you're just calling it one it's like they say cat can have kittens in the oven but that don't make them biscuits that reminds me of another saying you can lead a chicken to Crisco but you can't make your mother fry it Sheldon you pest me one more time about chicken I will put you over my knee right here in this restaurant please P her please for me hey give me the flowers and pie but if we show up in you're holding them she'll think they're only from you you they are only from me you said the gift of you was enough yes but now that I've seen what the gift of me with flowers and Pie looks like there's no going

was he his name is Ron I met him at my prayer group how long have you been involved with him a few months and of those few months how long have you been a demented sex pervert that is no way to speak to your mother perhaps not but it is a way to speak to a woman who quoted the Bible to me my whole life and then desecrates one of Ethan Allen's finest sofas I will give you one opportunity young man to apologize or what or I will send you to your room that's ridiculous I am a grown man I am a professional scientist and I currently occupy the moral High Ground go to your room but I occupy the moral High Ground go to your room but I'm a professional scientist go to your room I'm a grun man hello hello are you ready to discuss this calmly like adults I'm I am Shelly I'm sorry that you saw what you saw I know that this is hard for you I think what most upsets me about it mother is the hypocrisy doesn't this contradict all the religious rules you've been espousing your whole life you're right it does and it's something that I'm struggling with these days then why are you doing it because I'm not perfect Shelly and that man's booty is well this is confusing for me but I don't want to stand in the way of your happiness so I'll condemn you internally while maintaining an outward appearance of acceptance is very Christian of you mother if you're going to conduct your life in this fashion then I should let you know that the world has changed since you were a young woman you know it's not all sock hops Soda Jerks and segregation anymore how old do you think I am my point is that you're going to need to be careful you used to be protected by your pre-enlightenment mythology but now you're going to need a stronger friend named latex are you having the sex talk with me well

spent on the ring I think we're not in a rush we'll set a date when the time is right it doesn't matter sweetie the moment a man lays with a woman they are married in the eyes of the Lord the Bible is H to you no I'm sorry that was inappropriate as a psychiatrist I know how important people superstitions can be to them you want to talk about superstitions Sheldon sent me the books you wrote all that nonsense about super Egos and IDs what bull dropped that on the barn floor his name is Sigman Freud hey look at that you both believe in Jewish bearded guys stay out of [Music] this at least the bearded man that I believe in preaches love and compassion all yours talks about is why you hold in your poop and want to crawl back inside your mama it's fascinating how can someone as enlightened as Sheldon come from someone like you I know the answer you're not going to like it try me when I was pregnant with Shelly I was driving to church and I was praying to the Lord to give me a son smarter than his dumbass Daddy and I looked over and I saw a Jesus bobblehead in the Subaru next to me nodding yes what is that supposed to mean it means I can't believe we're having this conversation well do it some more maybe it knock some sense into yourself how we all stop hitting ourselves and talk about something safe you know like shoes or how cute little Chinese babies are it is not my fault that your mother likes me better than she likes you oh don't flatter yourself she likes everybody better than she likes me I'm just feeling a little guilty about all the trouble I've caused oh so am I you made God sad today Mom Sheldon they haven't done anything wrong I think it's nice they're hitting it off that's still the reason to rush into anything I mean look at us we took things remarkably slow you and I we didn't even hold hands for two years it's a lot hotter than it sounds you're a patient young lady hey hey She's Mine take a cold shower Grandpa there's a lot of traffic are we going to be okay you'll be at the airport an hour before your flight good thank you plenty of time for you to meet another geriatric boy toy hey I will not have you be disrespectful to me yes ma'am Sheldon your mother's an attractive woman you need to get used to the fact that men are going to be interested in her and you need to drive the car and mind your business I will not have you be disrespectful to me but you're not my mother don't you be disrespectful to her yes ma'am you'll get there you just got to put some zing on it that's a nice one was it yours when you were little my dad built it for me W it's so cute this was the husband this was the wife they'd go out on adventures together cruising skiing horseback riding that was really me just duct taping them to our dog and did they have kids they did but the mommy and daddy didn't like them so they shipped them off to an orphanage I made out of a shoe box yeah that's not worrisome at all not every girl dreams about being a mom sometimes you think you're never going to have kids and one day you wake up and you're pregnant and it doesn't matter that your career's going great right now and that you and your husband never even got to go anywhere take you dog I skip spin class for this oh wait wait we shouldn't we just eat you know I mean God did take time out of his busy schedule to bless these Sloppy Joe's come on shley tell me your news right this is on you Amy and I are living together in sin like a couple of New Yorkers now while you scold us I'm going to get a knife and a fork Joe may be sloppy but Shelton's not well thank you for letting me know and I for one am thrilled what what where's the Judgment where's the fire and brimstone where's the part where you tell us we're going to hell and I say have you seen the size of the bugs outside we're already there obviously I would prefer if you weren't living out of wedlock but given your special circumstances I'm very happy for you and what special circumstances are those how do I put this by your third birthday you had memorized over a thousand different kinds of trains and I never imagined a woman getting aboard any of them what's you thought I was going to be alone for the rest of my life no just for the middle part CU at the end I assumed there'd be nurses well this is highly insulting Sheldon don't overreact I'm the child she was worried about I have a brother and sister whose combined intellectual wattage couldn't power a potato clock if I spotted them the potato blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah what I was in my room I couldn't hear what they were saying hi Pen oh hello Leonard hello Mother how are you fine and you I'm great well it's been lovely catching up wait hang on we need to talk oh brother I want to know why aren't you proud of me well isn't the real question why aren't you proud of yourself no that is a question and I ask it a lot but let's stick with the one I asked you but why do you think I'm not proud of you because you never say it but two days into chatting with Penny and you can't stop telling her how great she is she is great honestly of all of my children's spouses she's the one that I'm most impressed by seriously yes she's confident she's thoughtful and she never complained about you once I know what kind of strength that takes so Penny's your favorite I suppose she is you married well Leonard and for that I am proud of you I don't I don't I don't know what to say I'm also proud of how hard you're trying not to cry thank you would you like to hang up now yeah here it comes can I have a moment alone I have you calmed down no I'm not calm you really hurt me that wasn't my intention it doesn't matter what you intended what matters is the way you made me feel actually the way you've always made me feel I see so you're here to tell me all the ways that I failed you as a mother yeah and get comfortable cuz it's a long list is it happening soon you know what it doesn't matter doesn't matter you're never going to change if I want you to accept me for me then I guess I'm going to have to accept you for you so I forgive you I didn't ask you to forgive me too bad I forgive you anyway and I forgive myself for taking so long to do it oh my God that feels so good I must admit it it does feel good what does you forgiving me it means a lot thank you for

frame and would are you okay yeah I'm okay did you spill ketchup no I'm not okay Sheldon why is this letter in the trash well there's always the possibility that a trash can spontaneously formed around the letter but razor would suggest that someone threw it out it's from The Institute for experimental physics they want us to present our paper on the properties of super solids at the topical conference on Bose Einstein condensates I know I read it before I threw it out okay if I may drill down to the Bedrock of my question why did you throw it out because I have no interest in standing in the Rose Room of the Pasadena Marriott in front of a group of judgmental strangers who wouldn't recognize true genius if it were standing in front of them giving a speech which if I were there it would be I don't know Sheldon those topical conference on Bose Einstein condensates parties are legendary forget the parties forget the parties what a nerd are there any other honors I've gotten that I don't know about did UPS drop off a Nobel Prize with my name on it Leonard please don't take this the wrong way but the day you win a Nobel Prize is the day I began my research on the drag coefficient of Tassels on flying carpets the only thing Miss from that insult was your mama I got one hey Leonard your mama's research methodology is so flawed shut up Howard Sheldon we have to do this no we don't we have to take in nourishment expel waste and inhale enough oxygen to keep our cell from dying everything else is optional okay let me put it this way I'm doing it you can't I'm the lead author come on the only reason you're the lead author is because we went alphabetically I let you think we went alphabetically to spare you the humiliation of dealing with the fact that it was my idea not to put too fine a point on it but I was throwing you a bone you're welcome excuse me I designed the experiment to prove the hypothesis it doesn't need proving what so the entire scientific Community is just supposed to take your word they're not supposed to but they should all right I don't care what you say I'm going to the conference and I'm presenting our findings and I forbid it you forbid it if I'm not taking credit for our work then nobody is so you admit that it's our work no once again I'm throwing you a bone and once again you are welcome oh no he didn't are there any questions yeah what the hell was that any other questions Dr Sheldon Cooper Here I Am the lead author of this particular paper thank you and you sir you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park and I saw these children on a marry go around what started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gases like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero I didn't skip it it's just an anecdote it's not science oh oh I see it was the Apple falling on Newton's head was that just an anecdote you are not Isaac Newton no no that's true gravity would have been apparent to me without the Apple you cannot possibly be that arrogant you continue to underestimate me my good man look if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me as I explained repeatedly unlike you I don't need validation from lesser Minds no offense really so why did you come because I knew you'd screwed this up maybe I didn't go to college when I was 11 like you maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 but you are not the only person who was smarter than everyone else in this room no offense and and I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation so you admit you're an egotist yes my name is Dr Leonard hoffstead and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you but he's worse okay that is it stop it you cannot blow up my head with your mind then I'll set over an aneurysm stop it you hit me you saw that he hit me trying to blow up my head so it was working it wasn't it was not you are a nutcase oh see about that heads up you people in the front row this is a Splash Zone stop it quit it is this usually how these physics things go more often than you think go tonight I have to go tonight what the hell is that I don't know but if cats could sing they'd hate it too my night I we take my hey guys hi where are you going what we just had to mail some letters and throw away some chicken you'll never guess what just happened oh I I give up I don't guess as a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation although as I'm saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot what was that believe it or not personal growth what happened all right remember when I auditioned for that Workshop production of rent but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why I have a conclusion based on an observation no you don't no he doesn't well the girl they picked to play Mimi she dropped out and they asked me to replace her oh congratulations what a lucky break it's not a big deal just a one night showcase but they invite a lot of casting people and agents so you never know I think I know no you don't he doesn't it's this Friday at 8 you guys want to come no because uh Friday we are attending a symposium on molecular patronum I think that's a week from Tuesday at 6 no it's this Friday at 8 oh too bad well I got to get to rehearsal see you guys see you let's go tonight you just lied to Penny yes I did and you did it so casually no rapid breathing no increase in perspiration so so lack of a physiological response while lying is characteristic of a violent sociopath Sheldon are you worried about your safety no I imagine if you were going to kill me you'd have done it a long time ago that's very true what do you see what do you see I can't the living room appears to be empty okay he must be in his bedroom my spare glasses are in my bedroom on my dresser next to my bat signal I'm not going in there Raj no way Jose well I can't do it I can't see anything it's all right Wireless mini cam and Bluetooth headset will be your eyes fine one more thing this is a subsonic impact sensor if Sheldon gets out of bed and starts to walk this device will register it and send the signal to the laptop at that point based on the geography of the apartment and the ambulatory speed of a six Sheldon you'll have 7 Seconds to get out glasses or no glasses won't my footsteps set it off no you'll be on your hands and knees now you'll need to get the sensor as close as you can to Sheldon's room but how do I carry it if I'm on my hands and knees stay low bear left now keep true what it means go straight I just say go straight don't say go straight when you're giving bearings you say keep true all right I just hit my head because he didn't keep true okay turn right the the the picture's breaking up angle your head to the right a little more a little more that's it now just keep true all right you're close enough to Sheldon's room deploy the sensor now turn it on it wasn't on no then why did I have to crawl oh I guess you didn't okay it's on good from this point forward you will have to crawl I know hang on the sensor's picking up something turn your head back you rat bastard told you the sensor would work why you deliberately stuck me with Sheldon come on I had to you see what he's like Betty Betty I'm hungry uh it's okay sweetie good news Letter's home no here you go good luck bye wait wait leard I'm hungry wait Penny take me with you I want grilled cheese some guy is auctioning off of miniature time machine prop from the original film and no one is bidding on it a time machine from the movie The Time Machine no a time machine from Sophie's Choice boy Sophie could have used a time machine in that movie did you see it it's rough oh that's cool it's only $800 yeah and that's my bid you bid $800 it was a Spur the- moment thing I figured it would go for thousands and I just wanted to be a part of it there's only 30 seconds left in the auction do you have 8 $100 not to blow on a miniature time machine well don't worry the way these things work is people wait until the last second to bid and then they swoop in and get it it's called sniping 15 seconds come on snipers 10 98 where are your snipers five snipe four snipe three snipe two snipe one oh congratulations you are the proud owner of a miniature time machine you lucky duck I wonder why no one else bid this is a classic piece of sci-fi movie memorabilia yeah I know I understand why no one else bid I don't know what you are worried about I think it really works in the room yeah it is by far the coolest thing I have ever owned the exact time machine that carried actor Rod Taylor from Victorian England into the post-apocalyptic future where Society had splintered into two factions the Subterranean morlocks who survived by feasting on the Flesh of the gentle surface dwelling Eloy talk about your chick magnets oh yeah the guy who lives next to me is always like I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony I have a Jacuzzi on my balcony but wait until I tell him I've got a time machine on my balcony stuff that in your Speedos jacuzzi Bob gentlemen I know we said we'd take turns but I think you'll agree that practicality dictates it remain here you can't just keep it here what if I meet a girl and say you want to come up and see my time machine it's at my friend's house how lame as that he's got a point all right I think we're going to need some ground rules in addition to the expected no shoes in The Time Machine and no eating in the time machine I propose that we add pants must be worn at all times in the time machine seconded was going to put down a towel I still want it on my balcony I say we move it on a bimonthly basis yeah that sounds fair now hold on bimonthly is an ambiguous term do you mean move it every other month or twice a month twice a month then no okay every other month no Sheldon you can't be selfish we all paid for it so it belongs to all of us now get out of the way so I can sit in my time machine okay I am setting the dials for March 10th 1876 good choice Alexander granbell invents the telephone and calls out for Dr Watson wait a minute I'd want to see that too so when it's your turn you can but if we all go back to the same point in time Belle's lab's going to get very crowded he'll know something's up also since the time machine doesn't move in space you end up in 18 76 Pasadena and even if he can make it to Boston what are you going to do knock on the door and say to Mrs Bell hey Mrs Bell big fan of your husband can I come in and watch him invent the telephone Mrs Bell was deaf she's not even going to hear you knock I have a solution first go into the future and obtain a cloaking device o how far into the future if I remember correctly Captain Kirk will steal a cloaking device from the romulans on stard date 50273 which would be January 10th 2328 by pre-federation Reckoning oh okay I am setting the dials for January 10th 2328 here we go into the future that was fun Leonard you left your underwear in the dryer downstairs those are not mine really they have your little name label in them yeah no I do I I use those uh just to polish up my spear fishing equipment I spear fish when I'm not crossbow hunting uh Penny this is Sheldon's twin sister Missy Missy this is our neighbor Penny hi wow you don't look that much alike can I get a Hallelujah

why not I don't celebrate my birthday shut up yeah you do well it's no big deal it's just the way I was raised my parents focused on celebrating a a Ms and being expelled from a birth canal was not considered one of them that's so silly it's actually based on very sound theories his mother published a paper on it well what was it called I hate my son and that's why he can't have cake it was obviously effective Leonard grew up to be an experimental physicist perhaps if she'd also denied him Christmas he'd be a little better at it thank you well I love birthdays waking up to Mom's special French toast breakfast wearing the birthday king crown playing laser tag with all my friends yeah see that's what kids should have actually that was last year so you really never had a birthday party no but it was okay I mean when I was little I'd think maybe my parents would change their mind and surprise me with a party like this one birthday I came home for My Cello lesson and I saw a lot of strange cars parked out front when I got to the door I could hear people whispering and I could smell German chocolate cake Which is my favorite and uh it turns out my grandfather had died oh my God

boyfriend in private like right now it's go why are you still here excuse me I think you're being a little rude I'm being rude you've been rude to me this entire evening how is that possible I've hardly spoken to you since we got on the train I'm detecting a little friction between you two and I don't want to be a third rail get it I get it leave what is your problem it's Valentine day we're supposed to be having a romantic weekend oh really because I remember you saying that this trip was going to be something we could both enjoy did you mean that or were you just trying to trick me fine it's true I deserve romance and I didn't know how else to make it happen well if you want romance then let's have romance oh look there's wine M grape juice that burns uh now let's gaze into each other's eyes you blinked I win let's see what's next oh kissing's [Applause] romantic that was nice good um the conductor said if I come back to the engine room he'd show me how to bring the train through a Crossing okay have fun do you want to come with me really I do hey guys wait up there's something else I've been wanting to say but before I do I just I want you to know that you don't have to say it back I know you're not ready and I don't want you to say it just because social convention dictates I love you too you said it there's no denying I have feelings for you that can't be explained in any other way I briefly considered that I had a brain parasite but that seems even more far-fetched [Laughter] the only conclusion was love I know what's happening this is a panic attack soccer mom 9 says to lie down with your feet elevated okay who whoa whoa whoa just because I love you doesn't mean girls are allowed in my room oh good you're back we have some exciting news Okay as you know Amy and I have been together a long time and a lot of things I never thought possible now seem possible okay after a careful evaluation of our relationship we decided that the time was right to take a step forward okay do you want to say it let's say it together we're getting a turtle this is why I've been saying we should keep champagne on Ice sarcasm yes that was tricky because when it comes to alcohol she generally means business well we're we're very happy for you thank you acquiring a joint pet is a big step for us no it's true it means that we care so much about each other there's enough left over for an 8 oce reptile why a turtle after much deliberation we've determined that a turtle is the ideal pet they don't shed fur uh they don't make noise for Halloween we can dress them as a cobblestone yeah and if he ever goes berserk I know I can outrun him coincidentally that's also why I chose you as a roommate well congratulations who would have thought you two' be the first in our group to start a family that's what I said hello hello listen I've been thinking a lot about relationships and how difficult they can be and I think I've been thinking about them too Sheldon being your girlfriend is so challenging emotionally physically I've been incredibly patient for years strongly disagree go on okay well this isn't easy to say because I love you but I need some time to take a step back and re-evaluate our situation oh I hope you understand okay bye Sheldon well Gollum you're an expert on rings what do I do with this one what are you doing here I'm here to return your belongings that's what people who've broken up do and you didn't do your compulsive knocking ritual so I would open the door on the contrary you no longer get to enjoy my charming eccentricities we're not friends with benefits just give me the Box wa wait don't you want to go through it to make sure I haven't forgotten anything fine my old scarf you wore the night we went ice skating remember you mean the night that I went ice skating and you stood at the rail Googling the symptoms of hypothermia we made one heck of a team huh whose bra is this it's not yours oh my but how embarrassing for both of us it's pennies hey you broke up with me it is none of your business whose naked bosom I'm smooshing around like pizza dough goodbye Amy Amy Amy tables work too good to know Amy there was a song I couldn't get out of my head eventually I realized the song was about you and like that earworm I can't get you out of my heart so what I'm trying to say is you're my heartworm the metaphorical kind not not the poodle killing kind what if I may I believe what he's saying in a charming and delightful way is that he loves you and wants you back Dave Gibbs huge fan of your work don't mind me I'm I'm sorry I didn't realize you were on a date no it it it's okay keep going Amy if you want to be my girlfriend again I really want to be your boyfriend I really want that too good

Shame I'm sorry what what am I looking at it's basically everything I've ever owned um every book every t-shirt every piece of broken Electronics just all of it all of it I have a Ziploc bag filled with all my old Ziploc bags okay well I would like to tell you that there is nothing here to be ashamed of so I'm going to need a minute which side of the bed would you prefer it doesn't matter to me your choice no no we're living together now everything's equal no I know that I have a tendency to be controlling so I would rather you choose well Sheldon I really appreciate that but these things mean more to you than they do to me so whatever you want well clearly it's not whatever I want because what I want is for you to make this decision and you refuse to do that I'm not refusing I'm just trying to be considerate but like when you let me get those shoes with the wheels on the bottom and then watch me roll right into traffic Char will you please just pick aide fine now on this side I am closer to the exit in case of emergency great that's your side no but I'm also closer to the entrance in case of attack okay I'll take that side ah then again what are the odds of someone attacking Rising rapidly now this side offers me proximity to the bathroom but I am close to the window where perverts can watch me sleep okay what if we do this I suppose that works great although now I'm kind of worried someone's hiding behind those drapes Amy you should know I was never really interested in seeing other women and to prove how serious I am about us I'm willing to take our relationship to the next level Amy Fowler will you share this toothbrush holder with me I would love to did we really need to be here for this call me crazy but I found it moving please stop trying to seduce me who's trying to seduce you after a long day I always turn on smooth jazz and spray deer musk on my inner thighs thought it smelled like a petting zoo in here anything you'd like to pet not my hair there's a lot of goop in it okay I've had enough what Amy come back I don't know how to open the oyster so were you turned on even a little bit it was like being hit on by ratpack PeeWee Herman I'm sorry is that a yes no Amy I didn't want it to come to this but you have left me no choice but to employ the most passionate seductive dance known to man The Flamingo [Applause] [Applause] for God's sake you're [Music] ridiculous well you guys are aroused right I was a close one I'm sorry you were embarrassed and now I understand that some things are just between you and me and in the event of redness and swelling Dr Fink what's that little dot in the middle that's reserved for thoughts I don't share with anyone interesting you really have secrets you don't tell me of course can I hear one no they're private why are they naughty a little please fine two years ago I got my driver's license what why didn't you say anything I like being chauffeured around it makes me feel important so when I got up at 4:00 a.m. to drive you across the desert to an antique Train Museum I didn't have to no you didn't I you keep in mind I felt extremely important go to the bedroom remove our clothes fold them neatly and engage in Fred love making what if we don't fold our clothes at all I or what if we fold them well here's your keyb thank you uh as soon as I have the place set up I'm going to have you guys over no we would love that I really can't thank you enough for taking me in you know I was at a pretty low place in my life oh Amy you naughty Vixen anyway uh as I was saying I was at a pretty low place in my life and uh if it wasn't for friends like you my goodness that form of stimulation is highly efficient I can't compete with that bye should we give them their privacy I want to but I don't think I can whoopy okay I'm good now Princeton has a beautiful campus yeah I've learned some fun facts about New Jersey to help you make small talk would you like to know the state bird or the murder rate they're both shocking actually I want to hear about you how are things at home well I'm a lot less likely to see an Eastern goldf or be murdered I'll tell you that I miss you I miss you too it's so strange earlier today I ended a sentence with a preposition and you weren't there to correct my grammar I am sorry you had to go through that in fact that's when I started to really miss you you know you just split an infinitive did I are you going to teach me a lesson I am it is naughty to put an adverb between the word two and the verb stem what are you going to do about it I'm going going to admonish you vigorously that's the only kind of admonishing I do are you seeking a romantic relationship with me what if I were well that would raise a number of problems we're colleagues I'm currently in a relation excuse me a moment you [Music] [Music] Amy Amy [Music] Amy will you marry me Amy you're up next decision come on first Dance come on first dance invitations that's a good one hey just a suggestion hologram projected out of R2-D2 thanks for your input but this is my decision and I'm going to go with Old English calligraphy on Egyptian Papyrus what a fun mash up it's like the chicken and waffles of orthography your turn ring bearer boy I'm so glad that R2-D2 is still available you know this is really fun I can't believe that people say that planning a wedding is one of the most stressful things in life I know you're not a day goes by that I don't Marvel how much better we are than other people Cooper Fowler you're up can you believe it we're about to walk in that door Dr Cooper and Dr Fowler and walk out as AER married couple Dr Cooper and Dr Fowler wait I want to have a first dance with you right here at our wedding this is our wedding no I want a real wedding Sheldon it was just making us fight I know but Amy I never thought I'd want to marry anyone so the fact that I found you is astonishing it's like finding Dark Matter except they're looking for dark matter I wasn't even looking for you so so you're even better than dark matter Sheldon plus plus you interact with light so I can see you and also you don't account for the missing mass in the universe oh and I think you're getting caught up on the ways I'm not like dark matter right sorry but when you make a discovery like this you don't just take it down to City Hall you tell the whole world and so I'll say it in Latin or Klingon or or smoke signals if if that's not cultural appropriation it is okay so not smoke signals but I want to do this right me too let's go plan a wedding are you having an allergic reaction to my botin ear no I'm just so happy for you and for me after today you are officially and more important legally Amy's problem don't be silly Leonard I will always be your problem hey baby hello mother Leonard could you give us a moment oh of course oh shell I wish your dad could see you now me too I miss him he would be so proud of you I know that I am thank you I mean for everything my whole life let me straighten your time no no no it's all right it's supposed to be a little asymmetrical apparently a small flaw somehow improves it I can see that sometimes it's the imperfect stuff that makes things perfect excuse me case in point Amy Amy Amy come in there's something I need to tell you wow you look amazing that's not what I need to tell you but you do what's wrong something incredible just happened remember when you were telling me about my boat Tha and how a little asymmetry is good yeah my equations have been trying to describe an imperfect world and the only way to do that is to introduce imperfection into the underlying Theory so instead of super symmetry it would be super asymmetry super asymmetry that's it give me your lipstick what just give it to me a beautiful thing we have work to do according to Google there are zero papers that mention super isymmetry this is Brad new no one's thought of it what are you lunatics doing Sheldon had a breakthrough well actually Amy and I had a breakthrough oh science a shocking you don't understand this could be really big no Penny's right we have our whole lives to do science together let's get married all right it's go time I am pumped good morning wife good morning husband I can't believe we're actually married it's official according to tradition we should hang the bed sheets outside so the villagers can see that we consummated I don't think that that's appropriate considering where we're starting our honeymoon well I suppose you're right although when you think about it Lego is the perfect metaphor from marital Congress two pieces that interlock with a satisfying snap oh that's the sound you were making oh I almost forgot while you were sleeping I ordered room service really voila you thought it was going to be food didn't you hello hello I brought you two hot dogs aren't you going to eat one from a street cart are you crazy I'm amazed that I'm holding them I'm not really hungry you realize that I'm not a particularly physical person I know now when I was little and people asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up I'd always say a brain in a jar sure yeah but I want to be a good husband to you and intimacy is a part of that please put those down I'm just worried that if I don't schedule our bedroom Endeavors then I may not think about them and you'll grow cold and distant and seek solace in the arms of a heavily muscled long shoreman where would I find a long shoreman along the shore it's in the name Sheldon I could never be with anybody but you that's good to know I wouldn't want to fight a man who's brave enough to touch a fish how's this for a compromise make all the schedules you want just don't tell me about them excellent I'll create an algorithm that'll generate a pseudo random schedule and do you know why it won't be a true random schedule because the generation of true random numbers remains an unsolved problem in computer science come with me where are we going to the hotel room and when we get there I'm going to need you to say that again except naked spending time with Michael and hiy today really made me think about our future children huh what an interesting and completely unforeseen development what are you thinking well I just can't decide either five sets of triplets or three sets of quintuplets you know what it doesn't matter as long as they're healthy and divisible by three that's a lot of babies sheld it oh only for humans for frogs it's just a drop in the bucket well sorry I'm not a frog oh don't feel bad Amy you're good enough for me [Music]

idY-dr-n_Cw,2024-04-18T14:00:29Z,Astronaut Howard Moments | The Big Bang Theory,all right this is an exact duplicate of the wallwood zero gravity human Waste Disposal system as deployed on the International Space Station don't you me the wallt zerogravity human waste distribution system good one yeah it's hilarious now here's an approximation of the fair parts available on the space station we got to find a way using nothing but this to reinforce this so the waste material avoids the spinning turbine you mean so it doesn't hit the [Laughter] fan yeah I have to say I thought the toilet humor would get less funny with repetition apparently there is no law of diminishing comedic returns with space poop Houston uh International Space Station we have a little situation up here we'd like to make an unscheduled Space Walk ISS Houston which crew members would be involved in this evva Houston uh we'd all like to step outside for a few minutes ISS I'm afraid we can't authorize that uh Houston this is more of an FYI call we are basically out the door sorry I'm late uh I got great news NASA picked my team's design for the Deep Field Space Telescope that's going on the International Space Station this spring W Howe that's wonderful congratulations it gets better someone has to go up with the telescope as a payload specialist and guess who that someone is Muhammad Lee who is Muhammad Lee Muhammad is the most common first name in the world Lee the most common surname as I didn't know the answer I thought that gave me a mathematical Edge it's me Sheldon it's me I'm going up in space technically I'm an astronaut amazing hang on a second as it doesn't have a shuttle anymore how are you going to get up there oh well it's really cool you fly to Moscow they take you out to Kazakhstan and then you get into a Russian so rocket which shoots you into a low earth orbit or it just sits there on the Launchpad because the kazaki mafia sold the rocket fuel on the black market this isn't the reaction I expected when I told you I was going to be an astronaut what did you think was going to happen happen honestly sex Howard do you realize what a big deal this is what an honor it is to be chosen to go into space yeah I get it I just wish you included me in the decision we're supposed to be partners we're supposed to be a team I'm sorry you're right uh let's try this again bernardet an opportunity has come up that impacts both of us and I'd like to discuss it okay I've been offered a chance to go up to the International Space Station for 3 weeks what are your thoughts on that well first of all thank you for including me in the decision making process hey we're a team so what do you think no hi sweetie I miss you I miss you too so tell me all about your first day oh wow where do I even start I got to experience zero gravity cool how do they do that it's pretty neat you get in this plane that goes almost straight up for like 20 seconds and then straight back down like it's going to crash and they do it over and over again no matter how many times you throw up you threw up yeah and the craziest part is because there's no gravity the throw up kind of floats there in a little ball and if your mouth is open because you're screaming sometimes it just floats right back in boy does everyone laugh at you when that happens that sounds mean no yeah I would have laughed too but I didn't want the vomit to come back out anyway oh could you do me a favor and overnight me some more underwear sure why I got to look at the centrifuge they're going to spin me around in tomorrow and I have a hunch I packed a little light Howe what happened to you we did overnight survival training in the wilderness big fun big big fun I was going to freshen up for you but I blacked out a little on the way to the bathroom survival training is that like camping uh-huh except you don't have food or water and they don't have a sunset Sabbath service like they do at camp has Kramer do you sleep in tents no I slept in a hole I dug in the ground with my bare hands and at some point during the night an armadillo crawled in and spooned me poor baby but I did it I survived I wasn't sure I was going to when the sandstorm hit just pulled my turtleneck up over my head and waited for death but somehow as I sat there wrapped in a cocoon of my own neck sweat I found that Primal part of the human spirit that just wants to keep on living no matter what the cost you're so brave I'm proud of you I ate a butterfly it was so small beautiful I was so hungry are you crying no I don't think it's possible I'm severely dehydrated my pee is like toothpaste hoe If you're not able to do this come home it won't change how I feel about you thanks honey but I can't quit if I do I'd just be a guy who had a chance to be an astronaut and gave it up well is there anything I could do to help no wait send more underwear I wonder what he's doing right this very second conducting experiments and zero gravity Beering through his telescope at the birth of the cosmos whatever it is we know his life life will never be the same Howard can you hear me I can hear you without the phone don't be snippy I'm just excited to talk to my baby I'm excited to talk to you too so what's this MOS about you moving out to go live with the little polish girl how about calling her my wife

got up to get a glass of water so I fixed it now you can show that corks are ASM totically free at high energies pretty cool huh cool listen I got to get to the lab thanks for a great night thank you I'll see you at work you D hold on hold on what who told you you could touch my board no one yeah I don't come into your house and touch your board there are no incorrect equations on my board oh that is so so I'm sorry I got to run if you come up with an adjective text me inconsiderate that is the adjective incons this is Lita Gupta Lita this is Leonard and Sheldon and Howard and Penny isn't it great she isn't fat anymore forgive me your highness for I am but a monkey and it is in my nature to climb I did not mean to gaze upon you as you comb your hair I'm sorry you're are the living embodiment of the beautiful princess panchali oh no kidding who who is that a beloved character from an Indian folk tale oh us Indian or come to our Casino Indian you Indian oh the resemblance is remarkable I can practically smell the Lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair well thanks I imagine you smell very nice too I shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as I can really so do I but you're a dentist he's nuts don't be insulting rajes so Sheldon tell me more about this princess do you say I look like it was said that the gods fashioned her eyes out of the stars and that roses were ashamed to bloom in the presence of her Ruby lips well my back off Sheldon what if you do not stop hitting on my lady you will feel the full extent of my wrath I'm not hitting on her and I am not your lady but and you have no wrath you are my lady our parents said so we are for all intents and purposes 100% hooked up okay let's get something straight here the only reason I came tonight was to get my parents off my case I certainly don't need to be getting this old world crap from you that's exactly the kind of spirit with which princess panchali led the monkeys to Freedom screw princess panchali hey you can't talk to me like that but you're not princess Pali luckily for you she could have you beheaded there any questions yeah what the hell was that any other questions Dr Sheldon Cooper Here I Am the lead author of this particular paper thank you and you sir you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park and I saw these children on a marry go around which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gases like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero I didn't skip it it's just an anecdote it's not science oh oh I see it was the Apple falling on Newton's head was that just an anecdote you are not Isaac Newton no no that's true gravity would have been apparent to me without the Apple you cannot possibly be that arrogant you continue to underestimate me my good man look if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me as I explained repeatedly unlike you I don't need validation from lesser mindes no offense really so why did you come because I knew you'd screwed this up maybe I didn't didn't go to college when I was 11 like you maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 but you are not the only person who was smarter than everyone else in this room no offense and and I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation so you admit you're an egotist yes my name is Dr Leonard hoffstead and I could never please my parents so I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you but he's worse okay that is it stop it you cannot blow up my head with your mind then I'll settle for an aneurysm stop it you hit me you saw that he hit me trying to blow up my head so it was working it wasn't it was not what you are a nutcase oh we see about that heads up you people in the front row this is a Splash Zone stop it quit it is this usually how these physics things go more often than you think Nerf oh dear God Leonard Leonard I'm sick I'm sick leard leard Leonard Leonard my comforter fell down in my side as is hurt when I bend over letter ow hey lard where are you I'm at work at 6:30 in the morning yes on Sunday yes why they asked me to come in I didn't hear the phone ring they texted me well as I predicted I am sick my fever has been tracking up exponentially since 2: a.m. and I am producing sputum at an alarming rate no kidding nope not only that it has shifted from clear to milky green ah how would it's the phone I know it's the phone Ma I hear the phone well who's calling at this ungodly hour I don't know well ask them why they're calling at this ungodly hour how can I ask them when I'm talking to you hello it's Leonard code milky green dear Lord not milky green all right and this is my office is this part of the tour nope goodbye come on Sheldon we've hardly shown him anything all right this is my desk these are my books this is my door please close it behind you goodbye looks like you're doing work in Quantum Loop Corrections Keen observation goodbye you see where he went wrong don't you Leonard yeah get him out come on Dennis I'll show you the rec center they've got Nautilus equipment do I look like I lift weights not heavy ones it's startling to me you haven't considered a Loren and ver in your field Theory approach you think I haven't considered it you really think I haven't considered it have you considered it get him out Leonard come on Dennis I'll show you the radiation lab wow you won the Stevenson award yes in fact I am the youngest person ever to win it really how old 14 and a half you were the youngest person ever to win it it's like looking into an obnoxious little mirror isn't it here's the problem with teleportation lay it on me assuming that device could be invented which would identify the quantum state of matter of an individual in one location and transmit that pattern to a distant location for reassembly you would not have actually transported the individual you would have destroyed him in one location and recreated him in another how about that personally I would never use a transporter because the original Sheldon would have to be disintegrated in order to create a new Sheldon would the new Sheldon be in any way an improvement on the Sheldon no he would be exactly the same that is a problem so you see it too the final question the score now stands AA 1150 PMS 1175 so for 100 points and the match please turn your attention to the formula on the screens solve the equation holy crap up what the hell is that it looks like something they found on the ship at Roswell come on think Leslie Leonard it's not going to work if you rush me you have to let me get there you are never going to let that go are you 10 seconds he doesn't have it he's got squat hea I need your answer the answer is minus 8 Pi Alpha hang on hang on a second that's not our answer what are you doing answering question winning physics Bowl how do you know anything about physics here I am janitor in former Soviet Union I am physicist lenr poly Technica go po bears well that's a delightful little story but our Arrangement was that you sit here and not say anything I answer the questions you didn't answer a question hey look now maybe you have democracy now in your beloved Russia but on this physics bow Team I rule with an iron fist ow hey he I need your official answer well it's not what he said then what is it I want a different question you can't have a different question formal protest denied informal protest denied I need your official answer no I decline to provide one well that's too bad because the answer your teammate gave was correct that's your opinion all right the winner of the match is hang on Sheldon is proving that you are single-handedly smarter than everyone else so important that you would rather lose by yourself than win as part of a team I don't understand the question in 1935 Irwin schinger in an attempt to explain the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics he proposed an experiment where a cat is placed in a box with a sealed VI of poison that will break open at a random time now since no one knows when or if the poison has been released until the box is opened the cat can be thought of is both alive and dead I'm sorry I don't get the point of course you don't get it I haven't made it yet you have to be psychic to get it and there's no such thing as psychic show them what's the point just like Schrodinger's cat your potential relationship with Leonard right now can be thought of as both good and bad it is only by opening the box that you'll find out which it is okay so you're saying I should go out with Leonard no no no no no no let me start again in 1935 Sheldon I think I've made a mistake I can can see that unless you're planning on running a marathon choosing both stuffing and mashed potatoes is a starch field redundancy no it's about penny a mistake involving Penny okay you'll have to narrow it down I don't think I can go out with her tonight then don't other people would say why not other people might be interested I'm going to talk anyway I assumed you would now that I'm actually about to go out with penny I'm not excited I'm nauseous ah then your meal choice is appropriate starch absorbs fluid which reduces the amount of vomit available for violent expulsion Sheldon this date is probably my one chance with Penny what happens if I blow it well if we accept your premise and also accept the highly improbable assumption that penny is the only woman in the world for you then we can logically conclude that the result of blowing it would be that you end up a lonely bitter old man with no progeny the image of any number of evil Lighthouse Keepers from Scooby-Doo cartoons comes to mind tell me whether or not to go through with the date stringer's cat wow that's brilliant you sound surprised [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]

tell me who I can and can't have a relationship with actually he can the Hindu code of Manu is very clear in these matters if a woman's father is not around the duty of controlling her base desires Falls to the closest male member of her family in this case Raj the code also states that if she disobeys she will be reborn in the womb of a jackal and tormented by diseases if true that seems like an awfully large gamble given that the prize is Leonard There It Is priia We're Indian we believe this stuff I think it also says that if you eat beef you need to live with cows for 3 months and drink their urine some of it makes sense some of it's crazy my point is you have such beautiful eyes you thought about getting Conta I tried in the seventh grade I could never get used to him oh that's too

STlcL1kYOGA,2024-03-21T18:00:11Z,Funny Moments from Season 11 | The Big Bang Theory,"Sheldon these are the heads of my research team Dr Zayn Dr Harris this is my fiance Dr Sheldon Cooper that's the first time I've said that and it kind of gave me the Goosebumps Dr Cooper we are so excited to meet you oh that's very kind of you but if you'd like I could autograph your menus after dinner but I better not see those on eBay no no no we're just excited to meet the man who landed This brilliant woman here oh that wasn't hard she threw herself at me now getting the universe to show me its naughty bits that that took some doing shon's a physicist oh oh that's nice Amy I recently read your paper on lesions in the olfactory receptors in the brain it was inspired oh well I guess it didn't stink if it did that rout wouldn't have known it I'm sorry I'm sure you don't want to sit here and listen to a bunch of work talk oh no I love it no let's talk about work Amy's work my work yeah know why don't we start with my work actually I do have a question for Dr Cooper when Amy first told you about her approach to synaptic tracing did you think it was going to revolutionize the field really that's your question what are you Entertainment Tonight you know what I'm going to give you a better question here um Dr Cooper I heard you were working on a top secret project for the US mil military why don't you tell us about that see that's a great question okay what was that like I can't tell you that is top secret hi you wanted to see me yes I wanted to talk to you about the email you sent me last night I sent you an email you bet you did hello Shalom and Aloha from the grave of Richard Fineman oh it's coming back to me please accept the following retraction I know I said physics is dead but it is the opposite of dead if anything it is Undead like a zombie speaking of which if Richard feineman came back as a zombie I would totally let him bite me any chance that's the end I got bit by a squirrel one I had to get rabies shots I cried so much my mother said don't be a b baby in conclusion physics is great squirrels suck and someday I'm going to put my mom in a cheap nursing home Yours Truly XOXO Dr Leonard hoffstein no I I can explain PS can you come pick us up the Uber driver won't open the door because Sheldon is covered in blue vomit oh I don't care you know me I just go with the flow Beach public pool they both sound awesome on second thought Beach I'd like to befriend a seagull that is crazy yeah will you email that to me have you played this for him no I'm worried he'll say I violated his privacy listen how happy he sounds I'm I'm up for anything as long as I'm with you what are you listening to nothing oh come on I want to hear we don't need GPS let's just see where the road takes us I see why you turned it off that guy sounds like an idiot honey that's you don't be silly my voice is deep and sonorous like a Caucasian James Earl Jones lukee I am your father see it is you I recorded you in your sleep oh look a hitchhiker I bet he has some interesting stories that's me it's you so you spied on me in my sleep Sheldon I'm sorry you've been doing this every night I couldn't help but wonder if it meant something well it doesn't are you sure I mean the pre Al cortex regulates impulse control so it's plausible that when we're asleep aspects of our personality that we repress might come out don't try to put science lipstick on your new age Pig and for the record you make noises when you sleep and I've never accused you of repressing your inner chainsaw if you want me to object at your wedding just give me one of these just wish I could make Howard feel as angry as I'm feeling well maybe you could do something he likes and make him jealous like what you ever read Tom Sawyer no chores he likes chores oo what kind of chores well you could change the batteries and the smoke detectors that would drive him crazy that's great oh he'll be so man smoke will be coming out of his ears yeah then the smoke detectors will detect it wa hold on why' you ask me about Tom Sawyer I'm just interested in you what you are sweeter than your [Laughter] applesauce okay I put new batteries in the smoke detectors did you do the laundry I sure did oh he's going to be steamed there's like his dress shirts at least he could still clean the oven so that's something go that's what he thinks where's your steel wool right here we make quite the team sure do okay you ready yeah almost I'm working on my facial expressions see uh I've got interested H I've got very interested and enraged why would you be enraged better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it okay and rolling hello I am theoretical physicist Dr Sheldon Cooper auditioning for the role of Professor Proton now Excuse me while I get into character hello I'm Professor Proton and today boys and girls we're going to have fun with science did you know you could calculate the mass of an electron using household items it's true all you'll need is a pencil some paper dry ice rubbing alcohol and a spool of 50 Micron thick Cobalt 60 wire and remember don't put it in your mouth or instead of becoming a scientist you'll become wildly radioactive hang on I have a question do you have any experiments that aren't life-threatening come on that was a perfect take and you ruined it oh look hey I did need enraged oh boy what what they cast the new Professor Proton is it Sheldon not exactly we it's will weaton I don't get how you can enjoy Cricket it makes no sense did you just come here to complain yeah that's a sport of my people oh that's rabi chandran Ashwin he's amazing he makes hardik panda look like bhanwar Kumar oh whoa whoa wo save some syllables for the rest of us hey I think that's Bernadette's friend over there oh yeah hey Richie I I hope this isn't awkward the last time we met I kind of embarrassed myself let's see if you can go two for two hey guys hey are you here by yourself yeah I couldn't convince anyone to come watch cricket with me tell me about it I had to drag this guy you're more than welcome to join us if you'd like thanks what' she say baller W that clears that up she's telling the bowler to bowl a Yer it's the most brutal ball in cricket I was at the match when sh B back to back yers well I was there too what a

about Liz and Newton done so Tesla is the one that invented the electric car no Benny no the car is just named after him okay you don't have to be so smug about it you know you went to see the movie it because you thought it was about scary it guys Tesla was a genius who invented our electrical grid Edison just wanted to get rich and famous didn't he invent the light bulb that's what he wants you to think but without the foundational work of Ebenezer kennersley Warren dearoo and James Bowman Lindsay you wouldn't know Edison any more than you know Ebenezer kersley Warren dearoo or James Bowman Lindsay isn't he sexy All Fired Up it really gets my current alternating if you know what I mean Addison was kind of a publicity hog and a bully yeah he electrocuted an elephant named Topsy just to make himself famous if had an elephant named to he would want for nothing also he'd be named jumbo and worse than that Edison filmed the first onscreen kiss so he's basically a pornographer although every time I put that in Wikipedia someone takes it out is your current still alternating we're lucky there aren't any elephants in here h hello Leonard I was going to write you an email but I'm a

you know allow me to explain I 45 days ago um I embarked on a railroad journey of healing because I when my University was making me do String Theory my favorite comic book store burned down and when my roommate got engaged my girl girlfriend wanted to move in with me which was no doubt a ploy just to see my well excuse my language but my bathing suit Parts sir may I use your phone I don't think so I understand that I'm half naked but there is a reasonable explanation while I slept in my Sleeper Car all my possessions were stolen now typically I wear pajamas but I recently adopted a hobo lifestyle and pajamas are the Sleep pants of the man I'll have you know mahat mandhi wore no pants and a nation rallied behind him my good man now before you walk away I know that I may appear deranged but I am in fact a world-renowned physicist ask me the difference between a boan and a feron you go ahead ask bans have integer spin fermion have half integer spin my legs are getting cold why won't anybody help me next question for the Butterfinger how long is a galactic year 250 million years yes y okay this one is for a cadberry Cream Egg oh it's not even Easter time this is crazy which archimedian solid has 20 regular triangular faces 30 square faces 12 pentagonal faces 60 vertices and 120 edges theed we are so smart why didn't girls like us in high school because we were awkward and weird and couldn't play sports right again the first pitch will be thrown out by NASA astronaut Howard wowit thank you thank you can you really throw a ball h quiddit team he yeah that's a no I have a message for the young people here today when I was asked to throw the first pitch a little voice in my head said I couldn't do it so I practiced and practic and you know what that little voice was right but then I remembered that that I'm not an athlete I'm a scientist so today's first pitch will be delivered to home plate by science ladies and gentlemen boys and girls I present to you a working prototype of the Mars [Applause] rover and here's the wind up and the pitch [Music] why is it going so slow cuz I'm an idiot who didn't think this through okay new plan we go to Disneyland play hideand-seek on Tom Sawyer's Island and then come back and see the end of the pitch okay Ming isn't going to make it go any faster there are some ways we could set our comic book store apart from the competition kids buy comic books it would be great to figure out a way to get more kids in the store you know when I was a kid I love going there but I could never get a ride ooh what if he got a van and drove around and picked kids up nice you like at parks and schools toy stores puppet shows hold on so your idea is to get a van and cruise the streets looking for kids to pick up yes and are you going to use candy to lure them in we are now hold on pause something doesn't make sense look in 2015 Biff steals the sports Almanac and takes the time machine back to 1955 to give it to his younger self but as soon as he does that he changes the future so the 2015 he returns to would be a different 2015 not the 2015 that Marty and Doc were in this is Hot Tub Time Machine all over again if future Biff goes back to 2015 right after he gives young Biff the almanac he could get back to the 2015 with Marty and Doc in it because it wasn't until his 21st birthday that 1955 Biff placed his first bet wait whoa whoa is placed right what do you mean is placed the right tense for something that would have happened in the future of a past that was affected by something from the future had will have placed that's my boy okay so it wasn't until his 21st birthday that Biff had will have placed his first bet and made his millions that's when he altered the timeline yeah but he had will haven't placed it what unlike Hot Tub Time Machine this couldn't be more simple when Biff gets the almanac in 1955 the alternate future he creates isn't the one in which Marty and Doc Brown ever used the time machine to travel to 2015 therefore in the new timeline Marty and Doc never brought the time machine wait is BR right Marty and Doc never had have had BR I don't know you did it to me I'm going with it Marty and Doc never had have had brought the time machine to 2015 that means 2015 Biff could also not had have had brought the almanac to 1955 Biff therefore the timeline in which 1955 Biff gets the almanac is also the timeline in which 1955 Biff never gets the almanac and not just never gets never have never hasn't never had have hasn't is right what about the late fees on our credit card because somebody didn't pay theill on time well maybe I would have paid it if I wasn't also doing everything else around here oh you're saying I don't do anything around here look at my torch chart she made a a I see it doe the dishes there's a star right there that was a kityy star putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes that pan had to

old are you I enjoyed it when you told me I was going to be losing my virginity I didn't think you meant showing me Raiders the Lost AR for the first time my apologies I chose my words poorly I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch anyway thank you for watching it it's one of my all-time favorites it was very entertaining despite the glaring story problem story problem you oh what a dewy-eyed moon CAF you are ERS of the Lost Arc is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas two of the most gifted filmmakers of Our Generation I've watched it 36 times except for the snake scene and the face melting scene which I can only watch when it's still light out but I defy you to find a story problem here's my jaw drop it all right Indiana Jones plays no role in the outcome of the story if he weren't in the film it would turn out exactly the same I see your confusion now you don't understand Indiana Jones was the one in the Hat with the whip no I do and if he weren't in the movie the Nazis would have still found the ark taken it to the island opened it up and all died just like they did let me close that for you I've Recon considered H you can't work where I work enjoy the rest of your evening sh I already signed the contract I cashed a check you are not going to come out of this looking good sh I don't understand I thought you said you were

be myn numbingly tedious excuse me I need to have a chat with my husband yeah now keep it short from what I gather brevity is your friend so are we good here listen to me sh misunderstood what I meant was if we work together there'd be too much of me for you not the other way around Howard if you're going to lie to your wife don't start the sentence with Sheldon misunderstood but that's a dead giveaway well okay fine I did say that and I think it's true I think if we work together and live together we'd get sick of each other yeah but to be fair he only said the part about him getting sick of you for the love of God why what exactly do you think you'd get sick of there's only options here are to fake a heart attack or have a real one it's nothing in particular is it my voice am I too bossy my arm is feeling numb nail bit that's the wrong arm for a heart attack doofus then I know you're in the zone but do you want some tea all right I can't believe I'm going to say this but you

this particular paper thank you and you sir you have completely skipped over the part where I was walking through the park and I saw these children on a Merry-Go-Round which started me thinking about the moment of inertia in gases like helium at temperatures approaching absolute zero I didn't skip it it's just an anecdote it's not science oh oh I see it was the Apple falling on Newton's head was that just an anecdote you are not Isaac Newton no no that's true gravity would have been apparent to me without the Apple it could not possibly be that arrogant you continue to underestimate me my good man look if you weren't happy with my presentation then maybe you should have given it with me as I have explained repeatedly unlike you I don't need validation from lesser Minds no offense really so why did you come because I knew you'd screw this up maybe I didn't go to college when I was 11 like you maybe I got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16. but you are not the only person who is smarter than everyone else in this room no offense and and I am clearly not the only person who is tormented by insecurity and has an ego in need of constant validation so you admit you're an egotist yes my name is Dr Leonard hofstetter and I could never please my parents who I need to get all my self-esteem from strangers like you but he's worse okay that is it stop it you cannot blow up my head

give up I don't guess as a scientist I reach conclusions based on observation and experimentation although as I'm saying this it occurs to me you may have been employing a rhetorical device rendering my response moot what was that believe it or not personal growth what happened all right remember when I auditioned for that Workshop production of rent but I didn't get it and I couldn't figure out why I have a conclusion based on an observation no you don't no he doesn't well the girl they picked to play Mimi she dropped out and they asked me to replace her oh congratulations what a lucky break
